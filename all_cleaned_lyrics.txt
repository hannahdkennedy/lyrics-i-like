When I was a child
I heard voices
Some would sing and
Some would scream
You soon find you have few choices
I learned the voices died with me
When I was a child I'd sit for hours
Staring into open flame
Something in it had a power
Could barely tear my eyes away
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever
Tame your demon
But always keep 'em on a leash
When I was 16 my senses fooled me
Thought gasoline was on my clothes
I knew that something
Would always rule me
I knew the scent was mine alone
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever
Tame your demon
But always keep 'em on a leash
When I was a man I thought it ended
When I knew loves perfect ache
But my peace has always depended
On all the ashes in my way
All you have is your fire
And the place you need to reach
Don't you ever
Tame your demons
But always keep 'em on a leash

Remember when you'd sing just for the fuck of it
And any joy it would bring?
Honey, the look of it was as sweet as the sound
Your head tilt back, your funny mouth to the clouds
I couldn't hope to know that song or know its words
Wouldn't claim to feel the same we felt the first time it was heard
I couldn't name that feeling carried in that voice
Was it that or just the act of making noise that brought you joy?
You don't have to sing it right
Who could call you wrong
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song?
You don't have to sing it nice
But, honey, sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along
So, honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Remember when you'd sing before we'd move to it?
And we'd scuff up our shoes
Honey, the groove of it was whatever you'd choose
"I Wanna Be Your Lover" or "The Fisherman's Blues"
You didn't always sing it right
But who could call you wrong
To put your emptiness to melody
Your awful heart to song?
You don't have to sing it nice
But, honey, sing it strong
At best, you'll find a little remedy
At worst, the world will sing along
So, honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Who could ask you be unbroken or be brave again?
Or, honey, hope even on this side of the grave again?
And who could ask you to be sound or to feel saved again?
But stick around until you hear that music play again
So, honey, sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing (remember when you'd sing just for the love of it?)
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Sing, sing (just for the love of it)
Sing, sing, sing, sing, sing
Remember when you'd sing just for the love of it
And any joy it would bring?

There is a roadway
Muddy and foxgloved
Never I'd have life enough
My heart is screamin' out
And in a few days
I would be there, love
Ever here that's left in
Me is yours just as it was
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the flame
Eyes at the heights of my baby
Let's hope at the fight of my baby
The lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And tell me if somehow
Some of it remained
How long you would wait for me?
How long I've been away
The shape that I'm in now
Your shape in the doorway
Make your good love known to me
Just tell me about your day
Just as it was, baby
Before the otherness came
And I knew its name
The drug, the dark, the light, the shame
Eyes at the heights of my baby
And this hope at the fight of my baby
And the lights were as bright as my baby
But your love was unmoved
And the sights were as stark as my baby
And the cold cut as sharp as my baby
And the nights were as dark as my baby
Half as beautiful too

You only feel it when it's lost
Gettin' through still has a cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers, love
Falling from you, drop by drop
What I had left here, I just held it tight
So someone with your eyes
Might come in time to hold me like water
Or Christ, hold me like a knife
We're born at night, so much of our life
Is just carvin' through the dark
To get so far, and the hardest part
Is who we are, it's who we are
You and I burned out our steam
Chasing someone else's dream
How can somethin' be so much heavier
But so much less than what it seems?
Darling, we sacrificed
We gave our time to somethin' undefined
This phantom life sharpens like an image
But it sharpens like a knife
We're born at night, so much of our life
Is just carvin' through the dark
To get so far, and the hardest part
Is who we are, it's who we are
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You only feel it when it's lost
Gettin' through still has its cost
Quietly, it slips through your fingers, love
Fallin' from you, drop by drop

Oh, there was a time when she'd lie in the grass
And imagine the places she'd never go
And there all alone she would pleasure herself
With thoughts of a man that she had never known
Lying there, she made a promise that one day she'd run
And she'd find just the man she was looking for
Well, she fell in love with that son of a gun
But he was not the man that she took him for
When he came to town, he came rambling in
On a great cloud of dust carried by the wind
Oh, it wasn't long before he pulled her in
And he asked her to come run away with him
He saw a pretty young girl who was ready to run
And she saw just the chance she'd been looking for
Well, she fell in love with that son of gun
But he was not the man that she took him for
They headed out west, driving into the sun
And he promised her she was the only one
Well, he was a thief, and he'd steal just for fun
He'd go cruising around with his little gun
He ran afoul of the law and decided to run
And he left her alone with their little one
Well, she was in love with that son of a gun
And the story between them wasn't done
When she finds him, she will make him regret he was ever born
When she finds him, she will make him regret he was ever born
When she finds him, she will make him regret he was ever born
When she finds him, she will make him regret he was ever born

One bright morning changes all things
Soft and easy as your breathing, you wake
Your eyes open, at first, a thousand miles away
But turning, shoot a silver bullet point-blank range
And I can scarce believe what I'm believing in
Could this be how every day begins?
The sky is set to burst, the gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup, the sun coming up
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(One bright morning comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(One bright morning)
One bright morning goes so easy
Darkness always finds you either way
It creeps into the corners as the moment fades
A voice your body jumps to calling out your name
But after this, I'm never gonna be the same
And I am never going back again
The sky is set to burst, the gold and the rust
The colour erupts
You filling my cup, the sun coming up
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(One bright morning comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(One bright morning comes)
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(One bright morning comes) yeah, yeah
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(One bright morning comes) hey, hey
Like I lived my whole life
Before the first light
(One bright morning comes)

I have come to speak with you about your daughter
She's no girl, she's a woman, sir, if she wants to go and see the world, she oughta
You have kept her here for twenty years alone
But I'll have you know she's fully grown and she sure knows just what she wants, my God
If you won't allow her leaving, I must take her
I'm seeing red and I'd kill you dead if you tried to keep her here, man, you can't make her
You imagine that she's just as pure as ever
But I have been known to shake her bones, yeah, we've been known to shudder and moan together
I am not the problem, you are
I am not the problem, you are
I love her, she loves me
I thought you should know
I love her, she loves me
I thought you should know

Remember, once I told you about how, before I heard it from your mouth
My name would always hit my ears as such an awful sound?
And the soul, if that's what you'd call it, uneasy ally of the body
It felt nameless as a river undiscovered underground
And the first time that you kissed me, I drank dry the River Lethe
The Liffey would have been softer on my stomach all the same
But you spoke some quick new music that went so far to soothe this soul
As it was and ever shall be, unearth without a name
Some part of me must have died
The first time that you called me "baby"
And some part of me came alive
The first time that you called me "baby"
These days, I think I owe my life to flowers that were left here
By my mother, ain't that like them, gifting life to you again?
This life lived mostly underground, unknowing either sight nor sound
'Til reaching up for sunlight just to be ripped out by the stem
And sensing only now it's dying, drying out, then drowning blindly
Blooming forth, its every colour in the moments it has left
To share the space with simple living things, infinitely suffering
But fighting off, like all creation, the absence of itself, but anyway
Some part of me must have died
Each time that you called me "baby"
And some part of me stayed alive
Each time that you called, each time that you called
Come here, ooh-la-la, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around
Ooh-la-la, come here, ooh-la-la
Whatever keeps you around, it keeps you around
The last time it was heard out loud
The perfect genius of our hands and mouths
Were shocked to resignation as the arguing declined
When I was young, I used to guess, are there limits to any emptiness?
When was the last time? Come here to me, when was the last time?
Some part of me must have died
The final time you called me "baby"
But some part of me came alive
The final time you called me "baby"

I still watch you when you're grooving
As if through water from the bottom of a pool
You're moving without moving
And when you move, I'm moved
You are a call to motion
There, all of you, a verb in perfect view
Like Jonah on the ocean
When you move, I'm moved
When you move
I'm put to mind of all that I wanna be
When you move
I could never define all that you are to me
So move me, baby (ooh)
Shake like the bough of a willow tree (ooh-ooh)
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
You are the rite of movement
It's reasoning made lucid and cool
And though it's no improvement
When you move, I move
You're less Polunin leaping
Or Fred Astaire in sequins, honey, you
You're Atlas in his sleeping
And when you move, I'm moved
When you move
I can recall something that's gone from me
When you move
Honey, I'm put in awe of something so flawed and free
So move me, baby (ooh)
Shake like the bough of a willow tree (ooh-ooh)
You do it naturally
Move me, baby
So move me, baby (ooh)
Like you've nothing left to prove (ooh-ooh)
And nothing to lose
Move me, baby
Ooh, ooh, ooh
(Oh) oh, baby, oh, baby (oh), mm
Move like grey skies
Move like a bird of paradise
Move like an odd sight come out at night
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh (hey)
My, my, oh
Move me, baby (ooh)
Shake like the bough of a willow tree (ooh-ooh)
You do it naturally (oh, oh-oh)
Move me, baby (oh, ay)
So move me, baby (ooh)
Like you've nothing left to lose (ooh-ooh)
And nothing to prove (oh, oh-oh)
Move me, baby (oh, ay)
So move me, baby (ooh)
Shake like the bough of a willow tree (ooh-ooh)
You do it naturally (oh, oh-oh)
Move me, baby (oh, ay)
Hey (oh, oh-oh)
Hey (oh)

Come here to me, I wish I was a mayfly on the River Tay
I'd fit all my joys and my pleasures in one perfect day
I wish I was the sunlight, just sitting on the Mississippi
I'd settle for a shopping trolley in the Liffey
In a shot, I'd swap my body for a body of water
Worry the cliffside top as a wave crashing over
I'd lower the world in a flood, or better, yet I'd cause a drought
If I was a riptide, I wouldn't take you out
I don't wanna be anything
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do everything if you'd hear me say
Hey, yeah, hey
Go look another way
Hey, yeah, hey
Look another way
Look, I wanna be loud, so loud, I'm talking seismic
I wanna be soft as a single stone in a rainstick
I wanna be the thunder of a hundred thousand hooves moving quick
If I was a stampede, you wouldn't get a kick
I wanna be the shadow when my bright future's behind me
I wanna be the last thing anybody ever sees
I hear he touches your hand, and then you fly away together
If I had his job, you would live forever
I don't wanna be anything, love
But I would do anything just to run away
I don't wanna be anything like this at all
But I would do everything if you hear me say
Hey, yeah, hey
Go look another way
Hey, yeah, hey
Look another way
(Hey, yeah) I don't wanna be anything (hey)
I don't wanna be anything
But I would do everything just to run away
(Go look another way) I don't wanna be anything
(Hey, yeah) I don't wanna be, wanna be, wanna be
Wanna be, wanna be anything (hey)
Don't wanna be anything, I don't wanna be anything (hey)
Hey, yeah (I don't wanna be anything, hey)
Go look another way (I don't wanna be anything)
Hey, yeah, hey
Look another way

Never feel too good in crowds
With folks around, when they're playing
The anthems of rape culture loud
Crude and proud creatures baying
All I've ever done is hide
From our times when you're near me
Honey, when you kill the lights and kiss my eyes
I feel like a person for a moment of my life
But you don't know what hell you put me through
To have someone kiss the skin that crawls from you
To feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the god that heroin prays to
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you
There are questions I can't ask
Now at last, the worst is over
See the way you hold yourself
Reel against your body's borders
I know that you hate this place
Not a trace of me would argue
Honey, we should run away, oh, someday
Our baby and her momma
And the damaged love she made
But I don't know what else that I would do
Than try to kiss the skin that crawls from you
Then feel your weight in arms I'd never use
It's the god that heroin prays to
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
It feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you
Feels good, girl, it feels good
Feels good, girl, it feels good
Feels good, girl, it feels good
Oh, to be alone with you

So tired trying to see from behind the red in my eyes
No better version of me I could pretend to be tonight
So deep in this swill with the most familiar of swine
For reasons wretched and divine
She blows outta nowhere, roman candle of the wild
Laughing away through my feeble disguise
No other version of me I would rather be tonight.
And, Lord, she found me just in time
'Cause with my mid-youth crisis all said and done
I need to be youthfully felt 'cause, God, I never felt young
She's gonna save me, call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children, Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues
Lord, it'd be great to find a place we could escape sometime
Me and my Isis growing black irises in the sunshine
Every version of me dead and buried in the yard outside
We'd sit back and watch the world go by
Happy to lie back watch it burn and rust
We tried the world, good God, it wasn't for us
She's gonna save me, call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children, Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues
Cut clean from the dream at night, let my mind reset
Looking up from a cigarette, and she's already left
I start digging up the yard for what's left of me and our little vignette
For whatever poor soul is coming next
She's gonna save me, call me "baby"
Run her hands through my hair
She'll know me crazy, soothe me daily
Better yet, she wouldn't care
We'll steal her Lexus, be detectives
Ride 'round picking up clues
We'll name our children, Jackie and Wilson
Raise 'em on rhythm and blues

She was wise beyond all others
On the island, she was my lover
We went wild, and it almost killed me, I was blind
But for thirteen days of sun and her, I thought I'd never die
I couldn't get tired, although I should have been sleeping
For the first time I wasn't hard of feeling
And at night, while the others were dreaming, we went wild
We'd go running through the temples and the forests of the isle
For thirteen of those sleepless nights, I thought I'd never die
I don't know what the hell it was that gave us so much life
On the island we went wild, we never closed our eyes
Don't know where she's gone or what she's done to who since then
She loved me right into the ground, I won't go wild again
I thought good times could last forever
Long nights and perfect weather
I tried to never say never, but I was wrong
The wildness of those days couldn't last for long
I woke up on the beach one day and found that she had gone
The rains had come, there was no sun, I felt so deadly tired
After thirteen days of loving her, I felt like I could die
We went wild
We went wild
We went wild
We went wild
We went wild
We went wild
We went wild
We went wild
We went wild

Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak
Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin' why I'm a-wanderin'
Nowhere the buses lay
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't, I will say my goodbyes to thee
Oh, there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes
Out there's a world that calls for me, girl
Headin' out into the unknown
Wayfarin' strangers and all kinds of danger
Please don't say I'm going alone
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
Well, if you won't, I will say my goodbyes to thee
Just 'cause I'm ready to die for you, baby
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' a life you've been given
If all you do is stand in one place
I'm on a river that winds on forever
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'
Maybe I'm headin' to die but I'm still gonna try
I guess I'm goin' alone

When I first saw you, the end was soon
To Bethlehem, it slouched and then
Must've caught a good look at you
Give your heart and soul to charity
'Cause the rest of you, the best of you
Honey, belongs to me
Ain't it a gentle sound, the rolling in the graves?
Ain't it like thunder under earth, the sound it makes?
Ain't it exciting you, the rumble where you lay?
Ain't you my baby?
Ain't you my baby?
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
If I was born as a blackthorn tree
I'd wanna be felled by you, held by you
Fuel the pyre of your enemies
Ain't it warming you, the world going up in flames?
Ain't it the life of you, your lighting of the blaze?
Ain't it a waste they'd watch the throwing of the shade?
Ain't you my baby?
Ain't you my babe?
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing can get a look in on my baby
Nothing fucks with my baby
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

I watch the work of my kin, bold and boyful
Toying somewhere between love and abuse
Calling to join them, the wretched and joyful
Shaking the wings of their terrible youths
Freshly disowned in some frozen devotion
No more alone or myself could I be
Lurched like a stray to the arms that were open
No shortage of sordid, no protest from me
With her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
Feeling more human and hooked on her flesh
I lay my heart down with the rest at her feet
Fresh from the fields, all fetor and fertile
It's bloody and raw, but I swear it is sweet
With her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blond hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-ooh
Whoa-oh, whoa-ooh
In leash-less confusion I'll wander the concrete
Wonder if better now having survived
Jarring of judgment and reasons defeat
The sweet heat of her breath in my mouth, I'm alive
With her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her sweetened breath and her tongue so mean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene
With her straw-blonde hair, her arms hard and lean
She's the angel of small death and the codeine scene

Sun comin' up on a dream come 'round
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from-
One hundred years from-
Sun comin' up on a dream come 'round
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from-
One hundred years from-
After all, darlin', I wouldn't sell the world
The way that things are turnin'
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'
Sun comin' up on a dream come 'round
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from-
One hundred years from-
Martyrs of our revolution
Their spinning caused the earth to shake
The problem brought its own solution
They power now the world we've made
After all, darlin', I wouldn't sell the world
For all the gold or sterling
If it falls, I would hold on for all it's worth
The future's so bright it's burnin'
Sun comin' up on a dream come around
One hundred years from the empire now
Sun comin' up on a world that's easy now
One hundred years from-

Don't take this the wrong way
You knew who I was with every step that I ran to you
Only blue or black days
Electing strange perfections in any stranger I choose
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
There's an art to life's distractions
To somehow escapes the burning weight, the art of scraping through
Some like to imagine
The dark caress of someone else, I guess any thrill will do
Would things be easier if there was a right way?
Honey there is no right way
And so I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I wake at the first crink of morning
And my heart's already sinned
How pure, how sweet a love, Aretha, that you would pray for him?
'Cause God knows I fall in love just a little ol' little bit
Every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day
Love with every stranger the stranger the better
Love with every stranger the stranger the better
Love with every stranger the stranger the better
Love with every stranger the stranger the better
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new
I fall in love just a little ol' little bit every day with someone new

Running with bulls, working my miracles
Holding my world together with a boot string
Living the dream, Benzos and gasoline
Coffee and blue light screens 'til the morning
If I tell you this is drowning, you'd tell me I'm walking on water
I could bring fire from the mountain, you'd tell me it feels a little colder
I don't wanna
Choose between being a salesman or a soldier
Just let me look a little older, let me step a little bolder
Choose between being a butcher or a pauper
Honey, I'm taking no orders, I'm gonna be nobody's soldier
Sick to my skin, watching the news again
Whatever you choose, you lose out in the long run
The paint on the walls come down like a waterfall
The goal I was aiming for was the wrong one
If I say that this is drowning, you'd tell me I'm walking on water
I could bring fire from the mountain, you'd tell me it feels a little colder
I don't wanna
Choose between being a salesman or a soldier
Just let me look a little older, let me step a little bolder
Choose between being a butcher or a pauper
Honey, I'm taking no orders, I'm gonna be nobody's soldier
(Nobody's soldier) mm, being a butcher
(Nobody's soldier) or a pauper, I'm
(Nobody's soldier) I'm gonna be
Nobody's soldier
I don't wanna choose between being a salesman or a soldier
Just let me look a little older, let me step a little bolder
Choose between being a butcher or a pauper
Honey, I'm taking no orders, gonna be nobody's soldier

I have come to speak with you about your daughter
She's no girl, she's a woman, sir, if she wants to go and see the world, she oughta
You have kept her here for twenty years alone
But I'll have you know she's fully grown and she sure knows just what she wants, my God
If you won't allow her leaving, I must take her
I'm seeing red and I'd kill you dead if you tried to keep her here, man, you can't make her
You imagine that she's just as pure as ever
But I have been known to shake her bones, yeah, we've been known to shudder and moan together
I am not the problem, you are
I am not the problem, you are
I love her, she loves me
I thought you should know
I love her, she loves me
I thought you should know

As a child, it was the place names
Singin' at me as the first thing
How the mouth must be employed in every corner of itself
To say "Appalacicola" or "Hushpukena," like "Gweebarra"
A promise softly sung of somewhere else
And as a young man, blessed to pass so many road signs
And have my foreign ear made fresh again on each unlikely sound
But feel at home, hearin' a music that few still understand
A butchered tongue still singin' here above the ground
The ears were chopped from young men if the pitch cap didn't kill them
They are buried without scalp in the shattered bedrock of our home
You may never know your fortune
Until the distance has been shown between what is lost forever
And what can still be known
So far from home to have a stranger call you, "Darling"
And have your guarded heart be lifted like a child up by the hand
In some town that just means "Home" to them
With no translator left to sound
A butchered tongue still singin' here above the ground

Two, three
It's the sound of it that brings me there
This city locked into the song of prayer
That finds no melody
Every moment of the working day
The twitching muscles in each step I take
The prayer is all of me
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are, that you are
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are, that you are
Maybe I have yet to venture out
See the places that I hear about
Planes and trains and cars
Carve their lines into curve-like blades
All I get to are mistakes half-made
Leave the door ajar
But I'd be
Anywhere that you are, that you are
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are, you are
But prayer
Is all of me, all of me
The prayer
Is all of me, all of me
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are, that you are
That I'd be
Anywhere that you are, that you are

True that I saw her hair like the branch of a tree
A willow dancing on air before covering me
Under cotton and calicoes
Over canopy dapple long ago
True that love in withdrawal was the weeping of me
That the sound of the saw must be known by the tree
Must be felled for to fight the cold
I fretted fire but that was long ago
And it's not tonight (oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (oh)
Of your blinding light (oh)
Oh, it's not tonight (oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (oh, oh)
Light the fire bright (oh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright (oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (oh, oh)
Oh, you're good to me (oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby (ooh)
With the roar of the fire, my heart rose to its feet
Like the ashes of ash I saw rise in the heat
Settle soft and as pure as snow
I fell in love with the fire long ago
With each love I cut loose, I was never the same
Watching still living roots be consumed by the flame
I was fixed on your hand of gold
Laying waste to my lovin' long ago
But that's not tonight (oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (oh)
Of your blinding light (oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (oh, oh)
Where you hold me tight (oh, oh)
Light the fire bright (oh)
Oh, let it blaze, alright, honey (oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (oh, oh)
Oh, you're good to me (oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby
So in awe, there I stood as you licked off the grain
Though I've handled the wood, I still worship the flame
Long as amber of ember glows
All the "would that I'd loved" is long ago
But it's not tonight (oh, oh)
Where I'm set alight (oh, oh)
And I blink in sight (oh)
Of your blinding light (oh)
Oh, and it's not tonight (oh, oh)
When you hold me tight (oh, oh)
Light the fire bright (oh)
Oh, let it blaze alright (oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (oh, oh)
Oh, you're good to me (oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me (oh, oh)
Oh, you're good to me (oh, oh)
You're good to me (oh, oh)
Oh, but you're good to me, baby

I have never known peace
Like the damp grass that yields to me
I have never known hunger
Like these insects that feast on me
A thousand teeth
And yours among them, I know
Our hungers appeased
Our heartbeats becoming slow
We lay here for years or for hours
Thrown here or found
To freeze or to thaw
So long, we'd become the flowers
Two corpses we were
Two corpses I saw
And they'd find us in a week
When the weather gets hot
After the insects have made their claim
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I have never known sleep
Like the slumber that creeps to me
I have never known color
Like this morning reveals to me
And you haven't moved an inch
Such that I would not know
If you sleep always like this
The flesh calmly going cold
We lay here for years or for hours
Your hand in my hand
So still and discreet
So long, we'd become the flowers
We'd feed well the land
And worry the sheep
And they'd find us in a week
When the cattle show fear
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
They'd find us in a week (Lay here for years or for hours)
When the weather gets hot (So long, we'd become the flowers)
They'd find us in a week (Lay here for years or for hours)
When the cattle show fear (So long, we'd become the flowers)
And they'd find us in a week
When the buzzards get loud
After the insects have made their claim
After the foxes have known our taste
After the raven has had its say
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you
I'd be home with you

I couldn't utter my love when it counted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
I couldn't whisper when you needed it shouted
Ah, but I'm singing like a bird 'bout it now
The words hung above
But never would form
Like a cry at the final
Breath that is drawn
Remember me, love
When I'm reborn
As the shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn
And I'd no idea on what ground I was founded
All of that goodness is goin' with you now
Then when I met you, my virtues uncounted
All of my goodness is goin' with you now
Dragging along
Following your form
Hung like the pelt
Of some prey you had worn
Remember me, love
When I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn
I fled to the city with so much discounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
Back to the hedgerows where bodies are mounted
Ah, but I'm flying like a bird to you now
I was housed by your warmth
Thus transformed
By you're grounded and giving
And darkening scorn
Remember me, love
When I'm reborn
As a shrike to your sharp
And glorious thorn

Babe
There's something tragic about you
Something so magic about you
Don't you agree
Babe
There's something lonesome about you
Something so wholesome about you
Get closer to me
No tired sigh, no rolling eyes
No irony
No "Who cares?", no vacant stare
No time for me
Honey, you're familiar
Like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison
Chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming
Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to sit outside your door
Babe
There's something wretched about this
Something so precious about this
Where to begin
Babe
There's something broken about this
But I might be hoping about this
Oh, what a sin
To the strand, a picnic planned for you and me
A rope in hand, for your other man
To hang from a tree
Honey, you're familiar
Like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison
Chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming
Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to sit outside your door
Honey, you're familiar
Like my mirror years ago
Idealism sits in prison
Chivalry fell on his sword
Innocence died screaming
Honey, ask me, I should know
I slithered here from Eden
Just to hide outside your door

Honey, this club here is stuck up
Dinner and diatribes
I knew well from our first hookup
The look of mischief in your eye
Your friends are a fate that befell me
Hell is the talking type
I'd suffer Hell if you'd tell me
What you'd do to me tonight
Tell me
Tell me
Tell me
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of
Honey, I laugh when it sinks in
The pillar I am upright
Scarcely can speak for my thinking
What you'd do to me tonight
Now that the evening is slowing
Now that the end's in sight
Honey, it's easier knowing
What you'd do to me tonight
Tell me
Tell me
Tell your man
That's the kinda love
I've been dreaming of (That's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love (That's the kind of love)
I've been dreaming of (That's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
That's the kind of love
Ooh (That's the kind of love)
Let there be hotel complaints and grievances raised (That's the kind of love)
And that kind of love (That's the kind of love)
Ooh (That's the kind of love)
Let there be damage ensued and tabloid news (That's the kind of love)
And that kind of love (That's the kind of love)
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
Ooh
That's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of
And that's the kind of love
I've been dreaming of

What you're given, what you live in
Darling, it finds a way to live in you
And your heart, love, has such darkness
I feel it in the corners of the room
(If I was any closer) After the gloom
(I could only lose me) I wanna lose me
(If I fade away, let me fade away) I, I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer) If I was any closer
(I could only lose me) I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away) No more than I was or than I
Want to be when you fall on me like night, every time
And I want to be so far from sight and mind
I wanna kill the lights
I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the sun
If you want it done
Let all time slow, let all light go
I don't need to know where we begin and end
I'd still know you, not being shown you
I only need the working of my hands
(If I was any closer) Do you understand?
(I could only lose me) I wanna lose me
(If I fade away, let me fade away) I, I wanna fade away with you
(If I was any closer) If I was any closer
(I could only lose me) I could be lost
(If I fade away, let me fade away) No more than I was or than I
Want to be when you fall on me like night
I wanna kill the lights
I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the sun
If you want it done
(If I was any closer, I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
(If I was any closer, I could only lose me)
(If I fade away, let me fade away)
I wanna run against the world that's turning
I'd move so fast that I'd outpace the dawn
I wanna be gone
I wanna run so far, I'd beat the morning
Before the dawn has come, I'd block the sun
If you want it done

Her eyes and words are so icy, oh, but she burns
Like rum on a fire
Hot and fast and angry as she can be
I walk my days on a wire
It looks ugly
But it's clean
Oh mama, don't fuss over me
The way she tells me I'm hers and she's mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
Calls of guilty thrown at me all while she stains
The sheets of some other
Thrown at me so powerfully, just like she throws
With the arm of her brother
But I want it
It's a crime
That she's not around most of the time
The way she shows me I'm hers and she's mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine
Her fight and fury is fiery, oh, but she loves
Like sleep to the freezing
Sweet and right and merciful, I'm all but washed
In the tide of her breathing
And it's worth it
It's divine
I have this some of the time
The way she shows me I'm hers and she's mine
Open hand or closed fist would be fine
The blood is rare and sweet as cherry wine

You've done me wrong for a long, long time
But after all you've done
I never changed my mind
Honey please, try to love me
Honey please, honey try
My love will never die
Flowers, flowers grow where I'm laid to rest
Honey, pick a blossom
And hold it, hold it to your breast
And you'll know that's my love
Bursting loud from inside
My love...
Oh my love, my love
Will never die

It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
It is the groundin' of a foot uncompromisin'
It's not forgoin' of the lie
It's not the openin' of eyes
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
It's not the shade, we should be past it
It's the light and it's the obstacle that casts it
It's the heat that drives the light
It's the fire it ignites
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
It's not the song, it is the singin'
It's the hearin' of a human spirit ringin'
It is the bringin' of the line
It is the bearin' of the rhyme
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Billie cried power
Mavis cried power
And I could cry (power) power
(Power) power
Power, Lord
Curtis cried power
Patti cried power
Nina cried power
It's not the wall but what's behind it
Lord, the fear of fellow man, his mere assignment
And everythin' that we're denied
By keepin' the divide
It's not the wakin', it's the risin'
And I could cry power (power)
Power (power)
Power, Lord
Nina cried power
Lennon cried power
James Brown cried power
And I could cry (power) power
(Power) power
Power, Lord
Billie cried power
Joni cried power
Nina cried power
And I could cry power
Power has been cried by those stronger than me
Straight into the face that tells you to rattle your chains
If you love bein' free
Lord, I could cry power (power)
'Cause power is my love when my love reaches to me
James Brown cried power
Seeger cried power
Marvin cried power
Power
James cried power
Lennon cried power
Patti cried power
Billie (power)
Dylan (power)
Woody (power)
Nina cried power

It's only said to be kind, the time that you have with love
You're never told, but you're loaned it
It's a lie, the high that you have with love
It feels like gold when you hold it
And know it's sweet, to know it when it's gone, baby
So why, why, why?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'? Hey
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Now the world falls apart, it starts with their actin' up
I wouldn't say it, but I blame them
The bleedin' hearts, the arts and that other stuff
All the same motivations will melt away
Like snowflakes on a tongue, baby
So why, why, why?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'? Hey
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you, why would you?
Why would you play it all on somethin' as hollow as trust? (Hey)
What if you gave it all to find that it wasn't enough? (Hey)
What if, under the gaze of all, you come short when the going gets rough?
Why would you be lovin'? (Hey)
Why would you be lovin'? (Hey)
Why would you be lovin'? Hey (hey)
And, hey, why would you be loved? (Ah)
Mm, hey, why would you be loved? (Ah)
They look for somethin' to be done for those that are most in pain
What about me and my achin'?
The scales rehung, the breakin' of yoke and chain
What about me and my breakin'?
And if you ain't for all, how could you try it all, baby?
So why, why, why?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'?
Why would you be lovin'? Hey
And, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you be loved?
Mm, hey, why would you, why would you?
Why would you play it all on somethin' as hollow as trust? (Hey)
What if you gave it all to find that it wasn't enough? (Hey)
What if, under the gaze of all, you come short when the going gets rough?
Why would you be lovin'? (Hey)
Why would you be lovin'? (Hey)
Why would you be lovin'? Hey (hey)
And, hey, why would you be loved? (Ah)
Mm, hey, why would you be loved? (Ah)
Why would you be lovin'? (Hey)
Why would you be lovin'? (Hey)
Why would you be lovin'? Hey (hey)
And, hey, why would you be loved? (Ah)
Mm, hey, why would you be loved? (Ah)
Mm, hey, why would you be loved? (Ah)
Mm, hey, why would you be loved? (Ah)

I'd be the voice that urged Orpheus when her body was found
(Hey, yeah)
I'd be the choiceless hope in grief that drove him underground
(Hey, yeah)
I'd be the dreadful need in the devotee that made him turn around
(Hey, yeah)
And I'd be the immediate forgiveness
In Eurydice
Imagine being loved by me
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you
I'd be the last shred of truth in the lost myth of true love
(Hey, yeah)
I'd be the sweet feeling of release mankind now dreams of, hey, yeah
(Hey, yeah)
That's found in the last witness before the wave hits
Marveling at God (hey, yeah)
Before he feels alone one final time and marries the sea
Imagine being loved by me
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (hey, yeah)
All the things I would do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you
I won't deny I've got in my mind now (hey, yeah)
All the things we could do
So I try to talk refined for fear that you find out (hey, yeah)
How I'm imaginin' you

Just a little rush, babe
To feel dizzy, to derail the mind of me
Just a little hush, babe
Our veins are busy but my heart's in atrophy
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave
You and I, nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
Something isn't right, babe
I keep catching little words, but the meaning's thin
I'm somewhere outside my life, babe
I keep scratching, but somehow I can't get in
So we're slaves to any semblance of touch
Lord, we should quit but we love it too much
Sedated, we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
Darlin', don't you, stand there watching, won't you
Come and save me from it?
Darlin', don't you, join in, you're supposed to
Drag me away from it
Any way to distract and sedate
Adding shadows to the walls of the cave
You and I, nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it
Sedated, we're nursing on a poison that never stung
Our teeth and lungs are lined with the scum of it
Somewhere for this, death and guns
We are deaf, we are numb
Free and young and we can feel none of it

Until the end
See how it shines
Why did we never run
Before our chance was gone?

She moved with shameless wonder
The perfect creature rarely seen
Since some liar brought the thunder
When the land was godless and free
Her eyes look sharp and steady
Into the empty parts of me
But still my heart is heavy
With the hate of some other man's beliefs
Always a well dressed fraud
Who wouldn't spare the rod
Never for me
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Wondering who I copy
Mustering some tender charm
She feels no control of her body
She feels no safety in my arms
I've no language left to say it
But all I do is quake to her
Breaking if I try convey it
The broken love I make to her
All that I've been taught
And every word I've got
Is foreign to me
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
Screaming the name of a foreigner's God
The purest expression of grief

I can't trust anyone, nor anything these days
If you are who you say you are, then show me your face
Came out of the ocean, like you came out of a dream
Your voice, it sounds familiar, but you are not what you seem
All the words of comfort can not take away my doubt
I decided if it kills me, I'll find out what you're about
I can't trust anyone, nor anything these days
But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers, you're the strangest that I see
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone, nor anything these days
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
I can't trust anyone, nor anything these days
If you are who you say you are then show me your face
Know enough to say, you are not what you claim to be
Well I've kept close watch upon you, and I don't like what I see
Can't escape the feeling that you give me in the night
I'll sleep with one eye open, and I'm not afraid to fight
I can't trust anyone, nor anything these days
But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers you're the strangest that I see
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone, nor anything these days
I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers your the strangest that I see
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone no anything these days
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name

You know the distance never made a difference to me
I swam a lake of fire, I'd have walked across the floor of any sea
Ignored the vastness between all that can be seen
And all that we believe
So I thought you were like an angel to me
Funny how true colours shine in darkness and in secrecy
If there were scarlet flags, they washed out in the mind of me
Where a blinding light shone on you every night
And either side of my sleep
Where you were held frozen like an angel to me
It ain't the being alone (sha-la-la)
It ain't the empty home, baby (sha-la-la)
You know I'm good on my own (sha-la-la), sha-la-la, baby
You know, it's more the being unknown
So much of the living, love, is the being unknown
You called me "angel" for the first time, my heart leapt from me
You smile now, I can see its pieces still stuck in your teeth
And what's left of it, I listen to it tick
Every tedious beat going unknown as any angel to me
Do you know, I could break beneath the weight
Of the goodness, love, I still carry for you?
That I'd walk so far just to take
The injury of finally knowing you
It ain't the being alone (sha-la-la)
It ain't the empty home, baby (sha-la-la, sha-la-la, la-la-la)
You know I'm good on my own (sha-la-la), sha-la-la, baby
You know, it's more the being unknown
And there are some people, love, who are better unknown

I had a thought, dear, however scary
About that night, the bugs and the dirt
Why were you digging? What did you bury
Before those hands pulled me from the earth?
I will not ask you where you came from
I will not ask and neither should you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
I knew that look, dear, eyes always seeking
Was there in someone that dug long ago
So I will not ask you why you were creeping
In some sad way, I already know
So I will not ask you where you came from
I would not ask and neither would you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We should just kiss like real people do
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
I could not ask you where you came from
I could not ask and neither could you
Honey, just put your sweet lips on my lips
We could just kiss like real people do
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh
Eeh-eeh-eeh-eeh, eeh-eeh-eeh

When stunted hand earns place with man by mere monstrosity
Alarms are struck and shore is shock by sheer atrocity
A cure I know that soothes the soul, does so impossibly
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on
Me and my babe relax and catch the manic rhapsody
All reason flown as God looks on in abject apathy
A squall and all of me is a prayer in perfect piety
A moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me
When the meaning's gone, there is clarity
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
And it's easy done, our little remedy
And the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
What yields the need for those who lead us, oh, so morally?
Those that would view the same we do through their deformity
Who view the deed as power's creed, as pure authority?
This moment's silence when my baby puts the mouth on me
Since it all begun to it's reckoning
There the reason comes on the common tongue of your loving me
Be thankful some know it lovingly
There the reason comes in the common tongue of your loving me, whoo!
Like a heathen clung to the homily
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me
So summon on the pearl rosary
Let the reason come on the common tongue of your loving me

If the wind turns, if I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
I feel lighter than I have in so much time
I've crossed the borderline of weightless
One deep breath out from the sky
I've reached a rarer height now that I can confirm
All our weight is just a burden offered to us by the world
And though I burn, how could I fall
When I am lifted by every word you say to me?
If anything could fall at all, it's the world
That falls away from me
You have me floatin' like a feather on the sea
While you're as heavy as the world
That you hold your hands beneath
Once I had wondered what was holdin' up the ground
But I can see that all along, love, it was you all the way down
Leave it now, I am sky-bound
If you need to, darling, lean your weight to me
We'll float away, but if we fall
I only pray, don't fall away from me
I do not have wings, love, I never will
Soarin' over a world you are carryin'
If these heights should bring my fall
Let me be your own Icarian carrion
If the wind turns, if I hit a squall
Allow the ground to find its brutal way to me
If I should fall on that day
I only pray, don't fall away from me

A joy, hard learned in winter was the warming of the bed
You'd shake for minutes there and move your legs
Wrap the blanket over you and keep your head within
Let your breath heat the air until you'd feel it getting thin
"Uiscefhuaraithe"
The feel of coldness only water brings
There are some things that no one teaches you, love
That come natural as a dream, you didn't know that you were in
And darlin', all my dreamin' is only put to shame
And darlin', all my dreamin' has only been given a name
But it came easy, darlin'
As natural as another leg around you in the bed frame
In summer's heat, I learned to dread, the comin' of the night
The awful things we do to make the head go quiet
You'd press your body to the concrete when you were small
The rains of winter seemed to never leave the walls
"Uiscefhuaraithe"
The feel of coolness only water brings
There are some things that no one teaches you, love
That God in his awful wisdom first programs in
But darlin', all my dreamin' is only been put to shame
And darlin', all my dreamin' has only been given a name
But it happened easy, darlin'
As natural as another leg around you in the bed
I wish I could say
That the river of my arms have found the ocean
I wish I could say the cold lake water of my heart
Well, Christ, it's boilin' over
But it happened easy, darlin'
Natural as another leg around you in the bed frame

It's time to run, they'll string me up for all that I've done
I'm going soon, gonna leave tonight by the light of the moon
I did it all for you, well, I hope you know the lengths I've gone to
What's a man to say? They'll be looking for me, I should be on my way
I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
But I ain't ever gonna let 'em take my life from me
I've no regrets, I will not ask for your forgiveness
Lower your defense, run away with me and it'll all make sense
I did it all for you, don't spurn me after all I've gone through
No time to rest, I'm gonna find me a life, baby, way out west
I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
But I ain't ever-
I will run, but I know that I'm beat
I decided my fate with my deeds
I will run but I know that I'm beat
I decided my fate with my deeds
It's time to run, well, I hope you understand what I've done
Run away for you, I'm gonna count the days 'til you make it through
I did it all for you, well, I hope you live the life you want to
My time is spent, but baby, please don't tell 'em just where I went
I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
But I ain't ever gonna let 'em take the life from me
I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
I wanted everyone to know you're the girl for me
I wanted everybody else in the world to know it
But I ain't ever-

Sometimes it returns like rain that you slept through
That washed off the world, the streets looking brand new
I will not be great, but I'm grateful to get through
The feeling came late, I'm still glad I met you
The memory hurts, but does me no harm
Your hand in my pocket to keep us both warm
The poor thing in the road, its eye still glistening
The cold wet of your nose, the earth from a distance
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Sometimes there's a thought, like you choose what you're doing
But it comes to naught when I look back through it
I remember the view, street lights in the dark blue
The moment I knew I'd no choice but to love you
The speed that you moved, the screech of the cars
The creature still moving, that slowed in your arms
The fear in its eyes gone out in an instant
Your tear caught the light, the earth from a distance
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
See how it shines
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Darling, there's a part of me I'm afraid will always be
Trapped within an abstract from a moment of my life
The weeds up through the concrete, the traffic picking up speed
All my love and terror balanced there between those eyes
See how it shines
See how it shines

Picture a man, seen like a speck out from this shore
Swimming out beyond the breakers like he's done his life before
He feels a coming of the squall will drag him out a greater length
But knows his strength and tries to gather it
And he swims on, turning back to shore again
Above the outer atmosphere of a world he's never seen
And looking down to his new home, he feels the rising of a wave
And knows, at once, he will not weather it
Like that man, I looked down into the depths when I met you
I couldn't measure it
Any time I'd struggled on
Against the course, out on my own
Every time, I'd burn through the world, I'd see
That the world, it burns through me
But when I'd (when I'd) let go (I'd let go)
My struggling form (my struggling form)
My willing soul (I'd see)
Every time (each time I'd)
I'd flow through the world, I'd see (flow through)
That the world (the world)
It flows through me (it flows through me)
That the world, it flows through me
Picture a grave, picture six feet freshly dug
The sharp temporary walls at the long-term cliff edge of the world
Light and air find some new deepness there and usher down the sky
Where one stands by, tries to make sense of it
Try measure loss, measure the silence of a house
The unheard footsteps at the doorway, the unemployment of the mouth
The waking up, having forgotten and remembering again
The full extent of what forever is
With each grave, I think of loss and I can only think of you
I couldn't measure it
Any time I've struggled on (I struggled on)
Against the course (against the course)
Out on my own (I'd see)
Every time (each time I'd)
I'd burn through the world, I'd see (burn through)
That the world (the world)
It burns through me (it burns through me)
But when I (when I), I'd let go (I'd let go)
My struggling form (my struggling form)
My willing soul (I'd see)
Every time (each time I'd)
I'd flow through the world, I'd see (flow through)
That the world (the world)
It flows through me (it flows through me)
That the world, it flows through me

I'm starvin', darlin', let me put my lips to somethin'
Let me wrap my teeth around the world
Start carvin', darlin', I want to smell the dinner cookin'
I want to feel the edges start to burn
Honey, I want to race you to the table
If you hesitate, the gettin' is gone
I won't lie, if there's somethin' to be gained
There's money to be made, whatever is still to come
Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinnin' the children for a war drum
Put in front of the table, sellin' bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young
You can't buy this fineness, let me see the heat get to you
Let me watch the dressin' start to peel
It's a kindness, highness, crumbs enough for everyone
Old and young are welcome to the meal
Honey, I'm makin' sure the table's made
We can celebrate the good that we've done
I won't lie, if there's somethin' still to take
There is ground to break, whatever's still to come
Get some
Pull up the ladder when the flood comes
Throw enough rope until the legs have swung
Seven new ways that you can eat your young
Come and get some
Skinnin' the children for a war drum
Put in front of the table, sellin' bombs and guns
It's quicker and easier to eat your young

At last when all of the world is asleep
You take in the blackness of air
The likes of a darkness so deep
That God at the start couldn't bear
And sit unseen, with only the inner upheld
Your reflection can't offer a word
To the bliss of not knowing yourself
With all mirrorin' gone from the world
But still the mind, rejectin' this new empty space
Fills it with something or someone
No closer could I be to God
Or why he would do what he's done

Winter wore me out like I was Prada
Threw up on me when the night was through
You can keep a dream in your mind
Only to find it's the hope that was killing you
But you arrived like sunlight in the gloom
And burned off the haze when the year was still new
Keeping me going how you show up
Like July, July, and July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
And July, July, and July is still coming
Just knowing that, it's getting me through
And you can go to work, until you're a disaster, babe
Build your temple, the sound, and stone
Put in all of their time only to find
By the end that your God has flown
Or all alone, he sank like a stone
Took root where he fell and started to grow
Blooming beyond us, like the promise of
July, July, and July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
And July, July, and July is still coming
Just knowing that's getting me through
July, July, and July is still coming
It's made real by the things that you do
And July, July, and July is still coming
Just knowing that's getting me through
July, July, and July is still coming
It's made real by the things you do
And July, July, and July is still coming
Just knowing that is getting me through

Without shame
Two outfits then to my name
You'd end up in one when you'd stay
We had nowhere to go
And every desire for going there
I heard once
It's the comforts that make us feel numb
We'd go out with no way to get home
And we'd sleep on somebody's floor
And wake up feeling like a millionaire
Wish I'd known it was just our turn (we just got by)
Being blamed for a world we had no power in (but we tried)
You and I had nothing to show (we didn't know anything)
But the best of the world in the palm of our hands, and darling
I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feelin' ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done
One time (time) we would want for nothin' (we had it all, love)
We knew what our love was worth (when we had nothing)
Now we're always missing something (I miss when)
I miss when we did not need much
Oh, if the car ran, the car was enough
If the sun shone on us, it's a plus
And the tank was always filled up
Only enough for our getting there
That first car was like wings on an angel (you flew away)
Before the whole wide world got too thin (from me then)
I swear, goodwill kept up the engine (just to turn back)
You were steering my heart like a wheel in your hands
And, darling, I haven't felt it since then
I don't know how the feelin' ended
But I know being reckless and young
Is not how the damage gets done
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young
All I needed was someone
When the whole wide world felt young

For starts
What a waste to say the heart could feel apart
Or feel complete, baby
Why would you make out of words
A cage for your own bird?
When it sings so sweet
The screaming, heaving fuckery of the world?
Why would you offer a name
To the same old tired pain?
When all things come from nothin'
And, honey, if nothing's gained
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
Let it hurl, let the awful song be heard
Blue bird, I know your beat, baby
But your secret is safe with me
'Cause if secrets were like seeds
Keep my body from the fire
Hire a gardener for my grave
Your secret is safe with me
And if secrets were like seeds
When I'm lying under marble
Marvel at flowers you'll have made
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the pain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again
My heart is thrilled by the still of your hand
It's how I know now that you understand
How big the hourglass, how deep the sand
I shouldn't hope to know, but here I stand
There's no plan, there's no race to be run
The harder the rain, honey, the sweeter the sun
There's no plan, there's no kingdom to come
I'll be your man if you got love to get done
Sit in and watch the sunlight fade
Honey, enjoy, it's gettin' late
There's no plan, there's no hand on the rein
As Mack explained, there will be darkness again

Be, be as you've always been
Be like the love that discovered the sin
That freed the first man and will do so again
And, lover, be good to me
Be the hope when Eden was lost
That's been deaf to our laughter since the master was crossed
Which side of the wall really suffers that cost?
And, lover, be good to me
Be
As you've always been
Be
As you've always been
Be, be as you've always been
True to the time and the placе you've been given
Your heart in thе world, and a world there within
And, lover, be good to me
Be there and just as you stand
Or be like the rose that you'd hold in your hand
That grows bold in a barren and an uneasy land
And, lover, be good to me
And, be
As you've always been
Be
As you've always been
Be
As you've always been
Be
As you've always been

I, I wouldn't fare well
And I, I couldn't fare well
Hedgehog under a van wheel kind of wouldn't fare well
Out here tryna feel good again
And I, I wouldn't fare well
A kitten cozy in the engine type of wouldn't fare well
A dog deep into the chocolate kind of wouldn't fare well
Out here tryna feel good again
I'll take any high
Any glazing of the eyes
Any solitary pleasure that was sorrow in disguise
Let the sun only shine on me through a falling sky
I'll be alright
Joy, disaster, come unbound here
I'll deny me none while I'm allowed
With all things above the ground
And I, I wouldn't fare well
A whale swimming up Sumida Gawa wouldn't fare well
Critic hoping to be remembered wouldn't fare well
Out here tryna feel good again
I'll take any high
Any glazing of the eyes
Any solitary pleasure that was sorrow in disguise
Let the sun only shine on me through a falling sky
I'll be alright
Joy, disaster, come unbound here
I'll deny me none while I'm allowed
With all things above the ground

Oh, there was a time when she'd lie in the grass
And imagine the places she'd never go
And there all alone she would pleasure herself
With thoughts of a man that she had never known
Lying there, she made a promise that one day she'd run
And she'd find just the man she was looking for
Well, she fell in love with that son of a gun
But he was not the man that she took him for
When he came to town, he came rambling in
On a great cloud of dust carried by the wind
Oh, it wasn't long before he pulled her in
And he asked her to come run away with him
He saw a pretty young girl who was ready to run
And she saw just the chance she'd been looking for
Well, she fell in love with that son of gun
But he was not the man that she took him for
They headed out west, driving into the sun
And he promised her she was the only one
Well, he was a thief, and he'd steal just for fun
He'd go cruising around with his little gun
He ran afoul of the law and decided to run
And he left her alone with their little one
Well, she was in love with that son of a gun
And the story between them wasn't done
When she finds him, she will make him regret he was ever born
When she finds him, she will make him regret he was ever born
When she finds him, she will make him regret he was ever born
When she finds him, she will make him regret he was ever born

I once kneeled in shaking thrill
I chase the memory of it still, of every chill
Chided by that silence of a hush sublime
Blind to the purpose of the brute divine
But you were mine
Staring in the blackness at some distant star
The thrill of knowing how alone we are, unknown we are
To the world and to the both of us
I confessed the longing I was dreaming of
Some better love, but there's no better love
Beckons above me and there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
Darling, feel better love
Feel better love
And I've never loved the darker blue
Than the darkness I have known in you, honed from you
You, whose heart would sing of anarchy
You would laugh at meanings, guarantees, so beautifully
When our truth is burned from history
By those who figured justice in fond memory, witness me
Like fire weeping from a cedar tree
Know that my love would burn with me
We'll live eternally
'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me, there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me, there's no better love
That justifies me, there's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love
Feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That beckons above me, there's no better love
That ever has loved me, there's no better love
So darling, feel better love
'Cause there's no better love
That's laid beside me, there's no better love
That justifies me, there's no better love
So darling, darling, feel better love
Feel better love

I came in from the outside
Burned out from a joy ride
She likes to roll here in my
Ashes anyway
Play it from the bedside
Is "Stella By Starlight"
There was my heart, the drums that start off
Night and day
The same kind of music
Haunts her bedroom
I'm almost me again
She's almost you
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
Tell me who, and I'd be thanking them
The numbered lovers of Duke Ellington
Do I owe each kiss to lip and cheek
As soft as Chet can sing?
Let's get lost and let the good times roll
Let smoke rings from this paper doll
Blow sweet and thick 'til every thought of it
Don't mean a thing
I got some colour back
She thinks so, too
I laugh like me again
She laughs like you
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't, mmm
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know where, I wouldn't know where
I wouldn't know
The very thought of you, and am I blue?
A love supreme, seems far removed
I get along without you very well
Some other nights
Lord, the radio newsreader chimes
Reporting Russian lullabies
She'll turn to me, awake and ask
"Is everything alright?" And, Lord
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (in the)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start (know where)
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where)
Be still, my foolish heart
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where, oh yeah)
Be still, my foolish heart (I wouldn't know where)
Don't ruin this on me
I wouldn't know where to start
Sweet music playing in the dark (I wouldn't know where, yeah)
Be still, my foolish heart (I wouldn't know where)
Don't ruin this on me

Boys workin' on empty
Is that the kinda way to face the burning heat?
I just think about my baby
I'm so full of love I could barely eat
There's nothing sweeter than my baby
I'd never want once from the cherry tree
'Cause my baby's sweet as can be
She give me toothaches just from kissin' me
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
That's when my baby found me
I was three days on a drunken sin
I woke with her walls around me
Nothin' in her room, but an empty crib
And I was burnin' up a fever
I didn't care much, how long I lived
But I swear I thought I dreamed her
She never asked me once about the wrong I did
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
My babe would never fret none
About what my hands and my body done
If the Lord don't forgive me
I'd still have my baby and my babe would have me
When I was kissing on my baby
And she put her love down soft and sweet
In the low lamp light I was free
Heaven and hell were words to me
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her
When my time comes around
Lay me gently in the cold dark earth
No grave can hold my body down
I'll crawl home to her

Springtime in the country
Each time, I'm shocked by the light
The world lyin' fallow and you are apart from me
Everything in my vision is movement and life
Riverboat, wheelbarrow, wildflower, and barley
Springtime in the country
I can smell summer on its breath
Low and harrowed lie the fields and the heart of me
Everything in my vision, departure, and death
Riverboat, wheelbarrow, wildflower, and barley
(The healers) this year, I swear it will be buried in actions
(Are healing) this year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
(I feel as) useful as dirt, put my body to work
Hm (ooh), hm (ooh)
Springtime in the city
The canal banks are empty again
The grass crying out to be heated by bodies
The streets for the laughter of young women and men
Canal boat and trolley, wildflower, and barley
(The healers) this year, I swear it will be buried in actions
(Are healing) this year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
(I feel as) useful as dirt, unreal unearth
(The healers) this year, I swear it will be buried in actions
(Are healin') this year, I swear it will be buried in words
(The diggers are diggin' the earth)
Some close to the surface, some close to the casket
(I feel as) useful as dirt, put my body to work
Hm (ooh), hm (ooh)
Springtime from my window
Another month has not much longer now
The sun hesitates more on each evening's darkening
Would all things God allows, remain above ground?
Like grief and sweet memory, wildflower, and barley

You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to look at it, look at it like that
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to talk to it, talk to it like that
Don't give it a hand, offer it a soul
Honey, make this easy
Leave it to the land, this is what it knows
Honey, that's how it sleeps
Don't let it in with no intention to keep it
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to it
Honey, don't feed it, it will come back
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to smile at me, smile at me like that
You know better, babe, you know better, babe
Than to hold me just, hold me just like that
I know who I am when I'm alone
I'm something else when I see you
You don't understand, you should never know
How easy you are to need
Don't let me in with no intention to keep me
Jesus Christ, don't be kind to me
Honey, don't feed me, I will come back
It can't be unlearned
I've known the warmth of your doorways
Through the cold, I'll find my way back to you
Oh, please, give me mercy no more
That's a kindness you can't afford
I warn you, babe, each night, as sure as you're born
You'll hear me howling outside your door
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling?
Don't you hear me howling, babe?

It can't be said I'm an early bird
It's ten o'clock before I say a word
Baby, I can never tell
How do you sleep so well?
You keep telling me to live right
To go to bed before the daylight
But then you wake up for the sunrise
You know you don't gotta pretend, baby, now and then
Don't you just wanna wake up, dark as a lake?
Smelling like a bonfire, lost in a haze?
If you're drunk on life, babe, I think it's great
But while in this world
I think I'll take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
Ooh
I aim low
I aim true, and the ground's where I go
I work late, where I'm free from the phone
And the job gets done, but you worry some, I know
But who wants to live forever, babe?
You treat your mouth as if it's Heaven's gate
The rest of you like you're the TSA
I wish I could go along, babe, don't get me wrong
You know you're bright as the morning, as soft as the rain
Pretty as a vine, as sweet as a grape
If you can sit in a barrel, maybe I'll wait
Until that day
I'd rather take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
Whoa, oh
I take my whiskey neat
My coffee black and my bed at three
You're too sweet for me
You're too sweet for me

Do you think I'd give up?
That this might've shook the love from me
Or that I was on the brink?
How could you think, darlin', I'd scare so easily?
Now that it's done
There's not one thing that I would change
My life was a storm since I was born
How could I fear any hurricane?
If someone asked me at the end
I'd tell them, "Put me back in it" (da-ah, darlin')
I would do it again (ah-ah, ah-ah)
If I could hold you for a minute (Da-ah, darlin')
I'd go through it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
I would still be surprised I could find you, darlin', in any life
If I could hold you for a minute
Da-ah, darlin', I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
For all that was said
Of where we'd end up at the end of it
When the heart would cease, ours nеver knew peacе
What good would it be on the far side of things?
It was too soon
When that part of you was ripped away
A grip takin' hold like a cancer that grows
Each piece of your body that it takes
Though I know my heart would break
I'd tell them, "Put me back in it" (Da-ah, darlin')
I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
If I could hold you for a minute (Da-ah, darlin')
I'd go through it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
I would still be surprised I could find you, darlin', in any life
If I could hold you for a minute (Da-ah, darlin')
I would do it again (Ah-ah, ah-ah)
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love like you and I
I would not change it each time
Heaven is not fit to house a love
Like you and I

My lover's got humour
She's the giggle at a funeral
Knows everybody's disapproval
I should've worshipped her sooner
If the heavens ever did speak
She's the last true mouthpiece
Every Sunday's gettin' more bleak
A fresh poison each week
We were born sick
You heard them say it
My church offers no absolutes
She tells me, "Worship in the bedroom"
The only heaven I'll be sent to
Is when I'm alone with you
I was born sick
But I love it
Command me to be well
A-, amen
Amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
If I'm a pagan of the good times
My lover's the sunlight
To keep the goddess on my side
She demands a sacrifice
Drain the whole sea
Get something shiny
Something meaty for the main course
That's a fine lookin' high horse
What you got in the stable?
We've a lot of starvin' faithfuls
That looks tasty
That looks plenty
This is hungry work
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, so you can sharpen your knife
Offer me my deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
No masters or kings when the ritual begins
There is no sweeter innocence than our gentle sin
In the madness and soil of that sad earthly scene
Only then, I am human
Only then, I am clean
Oh, oh
Amen, amen, amen
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life
Take me to church
I'll worship like a dog at the shrine of your lies
I'll tell you my sins, and you can sharpen your knife
Offer me that deathless death
Oh, good God, let me give you my life

A two-tonne weight around my chest feels like
It just dropped a 20-storey height
If there was anyone to ever get through this life
With their heart still intact, they didn't do it right
The last time I felt your weight on my chest, you said
"We didn't get it right, but love, we did our best"
And we will again
Moving on in time and taking more from
Everything that ends
And all things end
And all that we intend is scrawled in sand
It slips right through our hand
And just knowing
That everything will end
We should not change our plan
When we begin again
And we bеgin again, hm-mm
I have never known a silence like the one fallen here
Never watch my future darken in a single tear
I know we want this to go easy by being somebody's fault
But we've come long enough to know
This isn't what we want and that isn't always bad
When people say that something is forever
Either way, it ends
And all things end
All that we intend is scrawled in sand
It slips right through our hand
And just knowing
That everything will end
We should not change our plan
When we begin again
When we begin again
We begin again, hm-mm
Darlin'
And all things end
All that we intend was built on sand
Slips right through our hands
And just knowing
That everything will end
Won't change our plans
When we begin again
And all things end (knowin' we can always start again)
All that we intend (knowin' we have another day)
Is scrawled in sand (knowin' we can always start again)
It slips right through our hand (knowin' we have another day)
And just knowing (knowin' we can always start again)
That everything will end
Should not change our plan
When we begin again

If you got what you came for, why should you stay?
If you know where you're going, why delay?
If you won't be returning, don't say goodbye
Turn your back on the ocean and follow the sun through the sky
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
I've already forgotten all of your names
And I cannot remember when you came
Grab your things and get going, don't say goodbye
Turn your back on the ocean, go see what's out there to find
It's the time to let go
Goodbye and so long
All the best along the way
Couldn't I keep you another day?
It's the time to let go
Goodbye and so long
All the best along the way
Couldn't I keep you another day?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?
When will I see you again?

A husband waits outside
A crying child pushes a child into the night
She was told he would come this time
Without leaving so much as a feather behind
To enact, at last, the perfect plan
One more sweet boy to be butchered by men
The gateway to the world
Was still outside of reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men
The swan upon Leda
Empire upon Jerusalem
A grandmother smugglin' meds
Past where the god-child soldier, Setanta, stood dead
Our graceful turner of heads
Weaves through the checkpoints like a needle and thread
Someone's frightened boy waves her on
She offers a mother's smile, and soon she's gone
The gateway to the world
The gun in a trembling hand
When nature unmakes the boundary
The pillar of myth still stands
The swan upon Leda
Occupier upon an ancient land
The gateway to the world
Was still outside the reach of him
Would never belong to angels
Had never belonged to men

I would shun the light, share in evening's cool and quiet
Who would trade that hum of night?
For sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
But whose heart would not take flight?
Betray the moon as acolyte
On first and fierce affirming sight
Of sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
I had been lost to you, sunlight
And flew like a moth to you, sunlight, oh, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
All the tales the same
Told before and told again
A soul that's born in cold and rain
Knows sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
And at last can grant a name
To a buried and a burning flame
As love and its decisive pain
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
All that was shown to me, sunlight
Was somethin' foreknown to me, sunlight, oh sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight, sunlight
All these colors fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight
All these colors fade for you only
Carry me slowly, my sunlight
Each day, you'd rise with me
Know that I would gladly be
The Icarus to your certainty
Oh, my sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Strap the wing to me
Death trap clad happily
With wax melted, I'd meet the sea
Under sunlight, sunlight, sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
Oh, your love is sunlight
But it is sunlight
Sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight, sunlight

Breathin' in, breathin' out
How you been? You settled down?
You feelin' right? You feelin' proud?
How are your kids? Where are they now?
You build a boat, you build a life
You lose your friends, you lose your wife
You settle in to routine
Where are you? What does it mean?
If I get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't rise
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light
Mm
You bought some shit, you search online
You're gettin' lost, you're gettin' high
All alone, late in life
Scared to live, scared to die
You build a boat, you build a life
You lose your kids, you lose your wife
You settle down, you're feelin' lost
You're gettin' stoned, then kickin' rocks (three, four)
Hey
Ooh
If I get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't rise
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light
Oh, oh, oh-oh, ah, ah, ah (ah, hey)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, ah, ah, ah (hey, hey)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, ah, ah, ah (oh)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, ah, ah, ah (ah)
If you get too close
And I'm not how you hoped
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised out in the cold
If the sun don't shine
'Til the summertime
Forgive my northern attitude
Oh, I was raised on little light
Sick

My head was warm
My skin was soaked
I called your name 'til the fever broke
When I awoke
The moon still hung
The night so black that the darkness hummed
I raised myself
My legs were weak
I prayed my mind be good to me
An awful noise
Filled the air
I heard a scream
In the woods somewhere
A woman's voice!
I quickly ran
Into the trees with empty hands
A fox it was
He shook afraid
I spoke no words
No sound he made
His bone exposed
His hind was lame
I raised a stone to end his pain
What caused the wound?
How large the teeth?
I sure knew eyes were watching me
The creature lunged
I turned and ran
To save a life I didn't have
Deer in the chase
There as I flew
Forgot all prayers of joining you
I clutched my life
And wished it kept
My dearest love
I'm not done yet
How many years
I know I'll bear
I found something in the woods somewhere

All the fear and the fire of the end of the world
Happens each time a boy falls in love with a girl
Happens great, happens sweet
Happily, I'm unfazed here, too
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
All the things yet to come are the things that have passed
Like the holding of hands, like the breaking of glass
Like the bonfire that burns
At all worth in the fight fell too
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend
You are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby
And that day that we watch the death of the sun
That the cloud and the cold
And those jeans you have on
And you gaze unafraid
As they sob from the city ruins
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
And I love too, that love soon might end
Be known in its aching
Shown in the shaking
Lately of my wasteland, baby
Be still, my indelible friend
You are unbreaking
Though quaking, though crazy
That's just wasteland, baby
And the stench of the sea and the absence of green
Are the death of all things
That are seen and unseen
Not an end, but the start of all things
That are left to do
Wasteland, baby
I'm in love, I'm in love with you
That's it

If I held in my hands everything gold could buy
I'd still not have a thing worth giving you
You tell me the sun is shining in paradise
And I have to watch your lips turn blue
I would burn the world to bring some heat to you
I would burn the world to bring some heat to you
I would burn the world to bring some heat
You are the reason I went through it, oh
The only meaning as I knew it, my-yeah
I can only do my best, I do not do this for myself
I'd walk through hell on living feet for you
I wouldn't be seen walking through any door
Some place that you're not welcome to
You stare at the faces smiling from somewhere warm
Some place the sunlight won't come through
I would burn the world to bring some heat to you
I would burn the world to bring some heat to you
I would burn the world to bring some heat
You are the reason I went through it, oh
The only meaning as I knew it, my-yeah
I can only do my best, I do not do this for myself
I'd walk through hell on living feet for you
I would burn the world to bring some heat to you
I would burn the world to bring some heat to you
I would burn the world to bring some heat

Oh, there's a river that winds on forever
I'm gonna see where it leads
Oh, there's a mountain that no man has mounted
I'm gonna stand on the peak
Out there's a land that time don't command
Wanna be the first to arrive
No time for ponderin' why I'm a-wanderin'
Nowhere the buses lay
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
If you won't, I will say my goodbyes to thee
Oh, there's an island where all things are silent
I'm gonna whistle a tune
Oh, there's a desert that size can't be measured
I'm gonna count all the dunes
Out there's a world that calls for me, girl
Headin' out into the unknown
Wayfarin' strangers and all kinds of danger
Please don't say I'm going alone
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
There's a world that was meant for our eyes to see
To the ends of the earth, would you follow me?
Well, if you won't, I will say my goodbyes to thee
Just 'cause I'm ready to die for you, baby
Doesn't mean I'm ready to stay
What good is livin' a life you've been given
If all you do is stand in one place
I'm on a river that winds on forever
Follow 'til I get where I'm goin'
Maybe I'm headin' to die but I'm still gonna try
I guess I'm goin' alone

I sit alone in the dark, and I try to remember
The words you spoke when you summoned the Ender
You chained my life to an ancient master
Will the curse be reversed if I say it backwards?
What you crossed was a line at the edge of the void
And you can't crawl back without making a choice
But something escaped when you opened the gate
You cheated death and sealed your fate
Put on your new dress tonight
And look to the west, the moon's in the sky
I wanna get at least that high
Wanna leave the Earth and my things behind
You told me you're never gonna die
How am I supposed to sleep through the night?
You showed me the secret of life
I can't forget that look in your eye
It'd been a long time gone, living out on the coast
It's a long way back from the edge of the cosmos
Truths once known never come unknown
I learned that lesson lives ago
To die for good, it must be earned
The ways of death can never be learned
And the life I've lived is only dust
The darkness comes for all of us
Put on your new dress tonight
And I look to the west, the moon's in the sky
I wanna get at least that high
I wanna leave the Earth and all things behind
You told me you're never gonna die
How am I supposed to sleep through the night?
You showed me the secret of life
I can't forget that look in your eye

What I remember the most is hollerin' her name
And the sirens wail, as we ran like hell down the strange trail
Oh, I wanna know what I did, I wanna know her games
I wanna learn her wits, how she plays tricks
So I gotta know
Lots of booze in her kiss
These are drugs that do not mix
I was under her spell
And today I feel like hell
She got me goin', I guess
Well, who knew love would be like this
Don't know what I'm gonna do
But I guess I gotta see it through
'Cause I dunno how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
Don't know how to right the wrongs I've done
She bends the wills of men for fun
Don't know how to take my own life back
Everything she touches turns to black
Don't know how to fight what I can't see
That girl has laid a curse on me
I gotta find me a cure
I gotta clear my name
There's gotta be some way
I hope it's not too late to break the spell
Yeah, I'm gonna get her alone
I wanna ask her why
And look into those eyes
See the endless night, staring back, yeah
What kind of magic is this?
I was doomed by our first kiss
Just a pawn in her game
I've done things that have no name
And she'll make me do worse
Oh, if the life doesn't get me first
She's turned my heart black
And I know I can't turn back
There are runes on my skin
They appear when she walks in
I am bound by her spell
I am chained to do her will
I'm a goner, I guess
Well, who knew hell was gonna be like this
She's cloaked me in black
And there ain't no turnin' back
'Cause I dunno how to walk out of this deal
The spell she cast on me is real
Don't know how to right the wrongs I've done
She bends the wills of men for fun
Don't know how to take my own life back
Everything she touches turns to black
Don't know how to fight what I can't see
That girl has laid a curse on me
That girl has laid a curse on me

Heaven never ever heard a word I said
I've cried enough to raise the dead
"Everything comes and goes," they say
Here tomorrow, gone today
Heaven won't let me in, I don't know why
No one ever loved half as much as I
Everyone's a sinner in the balancer's eye
I've prayed enough, I rolled the dice
Anyone's luck can turn, I've heard
Not soon enough, I gave my word
I was born right into nothing
Under a very bad sign
Can I cross beyond that line?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Is it in my mind?
Nothing's waiting for us in the great sky
Life is equal to dust in the balancer's eye
Now I know that I can't lift an old curse
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Will I ever be forgiven for the crime of my life?
Will it haunt me 'til I die?
To the end of time
To the end of time
To the end of time
To the end of time
Heaven won't let me in, I don't know why
No one ever loved half as much as I
If I follow the starlight and call your name
Will I see you again on the astral plane?
Why did learnin' the truth make me feel worse?
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Doesn't matter; it's too late to do right
Heading into the void at the speed of light
Now I know that I can't lift an old curse
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Tell me, how does a man change the universe?
Follow the emerald star!

Many nights have I heard her voice
Whisper my name without making a noise
Calling out from a pure, black void
Tears of sorrow or tears of joy
Drops in my cup as my mind is destroyed
Staring into a pure, black void
So what if I'm living out past the edge?
So what if I never come back again?
Many evils have I enjoyed
Prowling the night, raising hell with the boys
Getting high on a pure, black void
I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void
So what if I'm living out past the edge?
So what if I never come back again?
Where can you go when it's all in your head?
These are the last words that I ever said
Where can you go when it's all in your head?
I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void
I am only an aimless soul
Heading into a pure, black void

"Good for nothin'" is the name they'll remember me by
Done nothin' with my life for no one, I'm just waitin' to die
I turned my back on the world
You know I'd given up on livin' 'til I met you, girl
Then you came into my life with "come hither" in your eyes
Pullin' me up out of the grave, oh, what a nice surprise
I die when our nights end
But I only stay dead 'til I see you again
Louisa
Louisa
I lie awake in the night just to see another dawn
Used to be the sun was my weakness, but them days are gone
I feel your lips on mine
Would you meet me by the river, baby, one more time?
I'll give you what you wanna have, take you where you wanna go
I'm the only man you'll ever need, girl, and now you know
I'll write your name on my skin
As a promise that we'll never be apart again
I feel alive when I'm with you, baby (Louisa)
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again (Louisa)
Don't wanna die, I wanna wander the world with you
And no one else for the rest of my days on this Earth
Louisa
Louisa
I turned my back on the world, I wasn't always like this, girl
Do you know what loneliness does to a man?
Turn him into the walkin' dead
I may have died, but your lovin' raised me, hey
I feel alive when I'm with you, baby (Louisa)
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again (Louisa)
You saved my life, I just wanna repay you in kind
Ain't no one else ever tell you you're beautiful, girl?
I feel alive when I'm with you, baby (Louisa)
So tell me that I won't ever be lonely again (Louisa)
Don't wanna die, I wanna wander the world with you
And no one else for the rest of my days on this Earth
Louisa
Louisa

Deep into the night
With the moonlight as my guide
I go wander through the pines
And make my way to nature's shrine
And I look up to the sky
And I know you're still alive
But I wonder where you are
I call your name into the dark
I wake up in the morning, oh
And I don't know where I've been
All alone on a mountainside
And I'm huddled in the wind
And it feels like I've been away for an era
But nothing has changed at all
And it feels like I've been with you, oh
But what did we do, and where have you gone?
On the night you disappeared
Oh, if I had seen it clear
But a strange light in the sky
Was shining right into my eyes
There was no one else in sight
Just the endless frozen pines
But I wonder all they know
'Cause they don't die and they don't grow
I am ready to follow you
Even though I don't know where
I will wait in the night until
You decide to take me there
'Cause I know I don't wanna stay here forever
It's time to be movin' on
Oh, I don't want to be the only one living
When all of my friends are gone
I will be waiting for you
On the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through
There's another life beyond the line
I will be waiting for you
On the other side of the frozen pines
I'm gonna find a way through
There's another life beyond the line

If you ever wanna see my face again, I wanna know
If you ever get lonely, please let me know
If you never wanna see my face again, I'll understand
If forever gets lonely, take my hand
Don't laugh, you'll make me cry
So long, good luck, goodbye
I know we will be together
In my mind, you're mine forever
In my mind, you're mine forever
If you're ever gonna leave this place
Don't wait, it's time to go
If you really wanna stay, I'll go alone
If you tell me where to meet
Then I'll wait 'til I turn to bones
Oh, we really should've left here long ago
Na-na, keep moving
Na-na, keep moving
Na-na, keep moving
Na-na, keep moving
Love is strange
I can't sleep without you
Maybe in the grave
I can do it without you
Everybody lies
But I'd never doubt you
Don't wanna die
But I can't live without you
I'm much too young to die
So long, good luck, goodbye
We will always be together
In my mind, you're mine forever
In my mind, you're mine forever
In my mind, you're mine forever
In my mind, you're mine forever
In my mind, you're mine forever
If you ever wanna see my face again, I wanna know
If you never wanna see my face again, I wanna know

Lost in time and space
Aimless drifting in a far off place
Hurtling through the vast unknown
Staring straight into the pure, black void
Drowning in the sea of stars
Lost in a galaxy of cocktail bars
Blinded by the neon lights
I lie awake and say your name into the night
I guess she's gone for good
She don't call me like I thought she would
She went west to chase her dreams
She took my money, but she didn't take me
Why go wander unknown worlds?
Stay right here and let the cosmos twirl
Blind without her source of light
I light a flame and say her name into the night
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am
Lost in time and space
Aimless searching for a long, lost face
Haven't got a thing to lose
If I don't find her, gonna tie that noose
I quit my job and packed my car
Left in a hurry, and I've sure come far
Driving fast with no headlights
I'm wide awake, I say her name into the night
Oh, I'll find a way, I say your name into the night
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am
I don't know who I am, I don't know where I am

I had a name, but they took it from me
I was the man that I wanted to be
I had a place to lay my head
But they burned it to the ground, and the sky turned red
I had a life and a place in the world
I had a sweet-talking wife and a beautiful girl
I know I'm never gonna see 'em again
Gonna tear the world up 'til I have my revenge
They took my life but it isn't the end
Oh, they put me in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
Whoo, my baby, whoo, my baby
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Oh, I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm comin' for them
Oh, they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
Oh, I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm comin' for them
Oh, they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
You hear me howl by the light of the moon
That's how you know that I'm comin' for you
Gonna find you alone in the dark of night
Oh, when the world ender comes, baby, run for your life
I never bleed and I won't ever age
I'll never feel the embrace of the grave
Oh, the fair and the brave and the good must die
I've seen the other side of livin', I know Heaven's a lie
I tear through the night and I raise some hell
'Cause I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm back from the dead
Lord knows I should be pushin' daisies
I was six feet down until somethin' raised me up
Sent back before I lift my curse
I'm gonna get me a taste of some chaos first
Untied, gonna get a little wild
Screamin' through the night like a demon child, yeah
Close your eyes now the light is fading
And the noise in the night is gonna get a little louder, baby
Whoo, my baby, whoo, my baby
Ba-ba-ba-ba-baby
Oh, I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm back from the grave
They can run for their lives, but they cannot be saved
I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm comin' for them
Oh, they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
Oh, I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm back from the grave
They can run for their lives, but they cannot be saved
I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm comin' for them
Oh, they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead
Oh, I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm back from the grave
They can run for their lives, but they cannot be saved
I'm a world ender, baby, and I'm comin' for them
Oh, they put my in the ground, but I'm back from the dead

I have a tale or two, to tell you
But the booze just makes me slow
Oh, I can wreck my brain remembering
But I guess maybe I'll just go
There's a method to my madness
There's a secret to this town
There's a reason why I'm still living here
Though I can't think of it right now
I made a promise when I left for the coast
20 long years ago
I made a life out of chasing a ghost
20 years takes its toll, ooh
I got along for a while I guess
But it took everything I had
I gotta find a way out of this mess
I'm in trouble and it sure looks bad, yeah
I have a thought or two to share with you
But thе dope tends to cloud my mind
I destroyed my health searching for myself
But there ain't nothing there to find
There a debt or two I owe you
But the gambling left me poor
I put up my name in the sacred game
And forgot what I was playing for
I made a promise when I left for the coast
20 long years ago
I made a life out of chasing a ghost
20 years takes its toll, ooh
I got along for a while I guess
But it took everything I had
I gotta find a way out of this mess
I'm in trouble and it sure looks bad, yeah
I gotta find a way out of this mess
I'm in trouble and it sure looks bad
I gotta find a way out of this mess
I went looking and it drove me mad
I gotta find a way out of this mess
I'm in trouble and it sure looks bad
I gotta find a way out of this mess
I ain't never seen you look so sad, yeah

My one and only love
Haven't lonely long enough
Will l find you when the night is over
Tell me where did you go
I've been searchin' high and low
I have only 'til the night is over
And every window I pass
Your reflection in the glass
Makes me wonder if my mind is goin'
Shadows shifting in the rain
Slowly drivin' me insane
By the stars above
I know we were in love
I have only 'til the night is over
I feel the weather change
I hear the river say your name
I watch the birds fly by
I see an emerald in the sky
Now the trail has gone cold
I don't know where else to go
And my time I fear is nearly over
When the ocean drinks the sky
And the city winks its eye
When the night is done you'll vanish in the sun
Will I hold you when the night is over?
Am I lost inside my mind?
There's an emerald in the sky
I hear the river say your name
By the stars above I know we were in love
I hear the river say your name
I have only 'til the night is over

I will wait by the river
In the light of the moon
At the edge of the city
I will wait for you
Though I can't wait forever
Someday I'll be dead and gone
And I won't be forgiven
For what I've done
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will cry out to heaven
As it rains down on me
I will beg for forgiveness
Get down on my knees
If I can't change the weather
Maybe I can change your mind
If we can't be together
What's the point of life
Baby, I didn't mean the things I said
I don't honestly wish you were dead
I'm a fool; I'm just a man
If I only could hold you again
And the stars fill the river
As it flows into the sky
And the mind leaves the body
And floats higher and higher
If we can't be together
I will leave this world behind
If I can't touch your body
Can I touch the sky?
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river
I will wait by the river.

I came back from the edge
Where you go when you die
I fell back down to Earth
Through a hole in the sky
I crashed into the sea
Then somehow I survived
Don't know what to believe
But I know I'm alive
Back from the edge
I was nearly destroyed
When I looked in her eyes
I got lost in the void
As I pondered the size
I got black-brained to death
But I just wouldn't die
I came back from the edge
I came back from the edge
Back from the edge
Back from the edge
Back from the edge
I came back from the edge
I came back from the edge

The sky doesn't care what my poor heart wants
And the desert can't hear my cries
The moon doesn't mind that I'm left all alone
And she's gone, gone

I am not the only traveler
Who has not repaid his debt
I've been searching for a trail to follow again
Take me back to the night we met
And then I can tell myself
What the hell I'm supposed to do
And then I can tell myself
Not to ride along with you
I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you
Oh, take me back to the night we met
When the night was full of terror
And your eyes were filled with tears
When you had not touched me yet
Oh! Take me back to the night we met
I had all and then most of you, some and now none of you
Take me back to the night we met
I don't know what I'm supposed to do, haunted by the ghost of you
Take me back to the night we met

I'm a long way from the land that I left
I've been running through life and cruising toward death
If you think that I'm scared you've got me wrong
If you don't know my name, you know it now
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those who came first
There are many more flames when mine is gone
They will build me no shrines and sing me no songs
I'm a long way from the one that I loved
I've been tending old flames, lamenting what was
Drifting in a that land time forgot
If you think that I've changed, you know me not
I belong bodily to the earth
I'm just wearing old bones from those who came first
I been unraveling since my birth
Going to wander out there and see what I'm worth
Find me way out there
There's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
They will take you who knows where
If I found a way
To stay with you tonight
It would only make me late
For a day I can't escape
Find me way out there
There's no road that will lead us back
When you follow the strange trails
They will take you who knows where
If I found a way
To stay with you tonight
It would only make me late
For a day I can't escape

Welcome back
Yep, alright
How about that?
What was that, French or something?
Dang
Now folks, from what I hear, this young fella coming up next is one hell of a performer
So without any further delay, let's see what he can do

I took a little journey to the unknown
And I've come back changed, I can feel it in my bones
I fucked with forces that our eyes can't see
Now the darkness got a hold on me
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me
How long baby have I been away?
Oh, it feels like ages, though you say it's only days
There ain't language for the things I've seen, yeah
And the truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
The truth is stranger than all my dreams
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me
I have seen what the darkness does
Say goodbye to who I was
I ain't never been away so long
Don't look back, them days are gone
Follow me into the endless night
I can bring your fears to life
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Meet me in the woods tonight
The truth is stranger than my own worst dreams
Oh, the darkness got a hold on me
I have seen what the darkness does
Say goodbye to who I was
I ain't never been away so long
Don't look back, them days are gone
Follow me into the endless night
I can bring your fears to life
Show me yours and I'll show you mine
Meet me in the woods tonight

Come on and meet me in the city
Get your courage up and take the highway down
Put on the dress you wore the night we met
You and me are gonna paint this town
We'll go wild and seize the night
Am I not the one you're dreaming of, my angel?
Go home and say goodbye forever
Tell your ball and chain you won't be back around
Forget the life you had and don't look back
Get your courage up and drink this down
If our love is so wrong, tell me, why does it feel so right?
Am I not the one you're dreaming of, my angel?
Meet me in the city, baby
Meet me in the city, baby
Meet me in the city, baby
Meet me in the city, baby
Am I not the one you're dreaming of, my angel?
Am I not the one you wanna love forever?

I get a thrill outta playing with fire
'Cause you hold your life when you hold that flame
I get a kick outta thunder and lightning
And tearing through the night hollering your name
I get a laugh outta starin' at darkness
And wondering why people live in the light
I drive fast and I rumble the hardest
I don't feel alive if I ain't in the fight
I can't sleep when there's something to do
You spend your whole life dreaming, and you wake up dead
It's a long night, can I spend it with you?
'Cause you're, oh, so pretty when you stand on the edge
Oh, little darlin', don't you look charming
Here in the eye of a hurricane
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?
Oh, little darlin', don't you like falling down
Through the sky like a diving plane?
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?
What is life? Only visions
When I die, I'm coming right on back for you
Who am I? An illusion
Would I lie? I'm coming right on back for you
Oh, little darlin', don't you look charming
Here in the eye of a hurricane
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?
Oh, little darlin', don't you get lonely?
Look in my eyes gimme one more day
Real or imagined, what does it matter?
Come inside, can I get you to stay?

I had a dream that you came to me shining down
Through the clouds like a moonbeam
There you were
And you wore nothing more than your raven hair
In the air like a moonbeam
Here you were
And you pulled me from a nightmare
With your eyes and your silver touch
Shone a little bit of light there
Now the darkness don't scare me much
You can feign your surprise, give me those doe eyes
But I know I wanna love you
Yes I do
We can dance to the beat while I tap my feet
On the stars, you're gonna like me
Yes you are
When you saved me from a bad dream
I was drifting through time and space
But I landed on a moonbeam
Take me out of this place
The world is dark the night is long
I could use a few laughs and a couple of songs
The sun will rise above the hills
You'll be leaving me soon, like hell you will
The awe when gazing at the moon
Is the feeling that I get when I'm lookin' at you
The sun will rise and fade the star
And you're leaving me soon, like hell you are
And you're leaving me soon, like hell you are
I had a dream that you came to me shining down
Through the clouds like a moonbeam
There you were
I had a dream that you came to me shining down
Through the clouds like a moonbeam
There you were

I've been lost before and I'm lost again I guess
But I never lost this feeling or this pounding in my chest
I have travelled many miles, I don't wanna walk no more
Every road and every highway led me right back to your door
Love me like you used to
And I'll praise you like I should
Love me if you choose to
Though you say that I'm no good
I dream most every night that I never left you
Do you love me anymore? Does my memory remain?
Lord I know I've made mistakes but I am different now, I've changed
When I open up the door, Will you know me from the rest?
Will you let me lay beside you? Will you grant me my request?
Love me like you used to
And I'll praise you like I should
Love me if you choose to
Though you say that I'm no good
I swear this time around I'm gonna stay
And when I dream I'll only dream of you
I curse the goddamn day that I went and left you
Ooh, ooh...
Love me like you used to
And I'll praise you like I should
Love me if you choose to
Though you say that I'm no good
Love me like you used to
And I'll praise you like I should
I don't wanna lose you
I would change it if I could
I can't erase the day that I went and left you (ooh, ooh...)

I'm leaving this place behind
And I'm heading out on the road tonight
I'm off for the hinterlands
Way up north, where the tall trees stand
Before I commence my ride, I'm asking Lily to be my bride
I know there's another man
But he ain't gonna delay my plans
I know she's gonna be my wife
Gonna fall in love, I'm gonna live my life with her
You know, I bet he's not so tough
Ain't afraid of him, 'cause I'm a fool for love
I've come far to find Big Jim
Well here I am, and I guess you're him
I see how you got your name
You're tall as hell and broad as a train
You say you're a hard-worn man
Oh, the baddest guy in the whole wide land
Well, I'm not afraid to fight
Let's step outside and I'll show you why
I'm hummin' like a revved up truck
Never mind the odds, I'm gonna try my luck with her
Just tell me when you've had enough
I'm dangerous 'cause I'm a fool for love
You know, you don't hit half bad
But I'm gonna lay you in the ground tonight
Just wait until I catch my breath
Gonna send you off to an early death
I lie in the drifting snow
Bleeding out as it covers me over
If spring comes before I'm found
Just throw my bones in a hole in the ground
I lost friends along my way
I knew I'd need them eventually
No, I'm not afraid to die
Just mad I left Big Jim alive
I know I should've never looked back
But you ain't gonna win a woman's heart like that
I never should've called his bluff
I was born to lose, 'cause I'm a fool for love
I stare into the endless sky
And the sorry tale of my life goes by
I drift into the great unknown
And I really don't know where I'm going
I stare into the endless sky
And the sorry tale of my life goes by
I drift into the great unknown
And I really don't know where I'm going

Alrightㅤ
And what would you like to sing for us tonight?

Gone are the days of laughter and love
Gone, baby, gone, we've all had enough
Carry on and spend all your dough
Take it down to the ground and sink me below
I scream and shout like this
Just to prove to the world that I still exist
I don't believe in life
And I won't believe in death 'til I die
Gone are the days of laughter and love
Gone, baby, gone, we've all had enough
Carry on to spend all your dough
Take it down to the ground and sink me below
I live my life like this
Just to prove to the world that I still exist
I don't believe in life
And I won't believe in death 'til I die

Yellow lines, in the dead of the night
Oh, I was heading back out West
Trying to keep my eyes open wide
I'd gone days without any rest
Saw a line in the road looking back
About twenty yards ahead
You come back from a trip to the East
But you don't come back from the dead
Sure as hell he was dead as they come,
And he was already starting to smell
Just a kid, with his hair slicked back
And a knife tucked into his belt
Was he unforgiven
Or just tired of living a life that never felt like his?
Though I was worn and weary
I thought I'd bury him
And lay his soul to rest out in the desert night
I laid him down, in a grave in the sand
And he grabbed my arm with his dead man's hand
He said "I know I'm dead
But I don't want to lie in a grave out here where the coyotes cry.
I stared right into the endless Void,
And I ain't going back if I got any choice
I know how to live, I don't know how to die,
And there ain't no thrills in the afterlife
So lift me up out of here, my friend,
And I'll wander the night 'til the ages end."
Lit by the moon, he walked through the sand,
And he waved "goodbye" with his dead man's hand
And he will roam, forever, unto the desert
And he will roam, forever, unto the desert

What you're looking for won't be found easily
It grows upon the mountain, in a sacred place
Up beyond the clouds an ancient ground, so they say
And many men have died trekking up that way
Once he's gazed upon her, a man is forever changed
The bravest men return with darkened hearts and phantom pain
Ages come and go but her life goes on the same
She lives to see the sun and feel the wind and drink the rain
Her colors change to mark the passing of the days
No earthly sight can match the beauty she displays
And when I die, I want her lying by my side
In my grave
In my grave
I'd give it all to love that girl, oh
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur, oh
I've meant to find the place where all good things begin
To smell her scent and watch her dancing in the wind
And when I die, I want her lying by my side
In my grave
In my grave
I'd give it all to love that girl, oh
I'd be the one to pluck that fleur, oh
I'd give it all to love that girl, oh
I'll be the one to pluck that fleur, oh

Here by the lake, what a vision you are
In the light of the emerald star
I've come for you, my love
Through a window in the dark
Don't you know you're my everything?
If I lost you, I think I would die
Was everything you said just a lie?
You never loved me
I came all the way through time and space
To take you away and out of this place
With the moonlight in your eyes
You're the brightest star in all of the sky
I'll cry and I'll cry if your light ever dies
Oh, what a jewel are you
And, oh, what a fool am I
For squandering my love
On an emerald in the sky
Way out here in the void
Is the loneliest place to die
When everything you loved is a lie
You never loved me
I came all the way through time and space
To take you away and out of this place
You're an emerald in the sky
You light up the night by blinkin' your eyes
I'll cry and I'll cry if your light ever dies

I will wake her in the morning
Once the dew has dried
I will say it to her face
You're a conjured lie a figment of my mind
Baby, I don't mind
Are you dead or are you alive?
She was gone without a warning
Long before the sunrise
I will paint the perfect face
I will draw her eyes with pigment of my mind
I will trace her lines
'Cause I have traced them thousands of times
All my days are filled with mourning
All my nights are empty
I just stare out into space
Searching for her eyes in a never-ending sky
Leave me where I lie
I don't care if I live or die
I will never ever love another one the way I loved her
If I ever learn to love again
I will wait until the end
'Cause I don't know where, I don't know when
Baby, I'm gon' see her again
I will never ever love another one the way I loved her
If I ever learn to love again
I will wait until the end
'Cause I don't know where, I don't know when
Baby, I'm gon' see her again
I will wake her in the morning
I will wake her in the morning

Well, the neon lights burned red and gold
I came to have my fortune told
Can't imagine what she saw
While gazing in her crystal ball
Far out past the astral plane
I cast you back from whence you came
Cosmic ash and blackened brain
I call you by your ancient names
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her
What the fortune teller said is
I'm alive for now but good as dead
She claims she'd seen it all
While she was gazing in her crystal ball
If I can't evade my fate
Then I won't sit around and wait
A fallen star will be thy bane
I call you by your ancient names
I gotta get away from here
(I'll never see the golden sunrise)
I gotta get away from her
(Oh, if I leave this place alive)
I gotta get away from here
(I'll never see the golden sunrise)
Oh I gotta get away from her
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her
I gotta get away from here
I gotta get away from her
I gotta get away from here
If I live to see the next sunrise
I gotta get away from her
Oh, if I leave this place alive

I know the rain like the clouds know the sky
I speak to birds and tell them where to fly
I sing the songs that you hear on the breeze
I write the names of the rocks and the trees
Oh, you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins
I tried to warn you when you were a child
I told you not to get lost in the wild
I sent you omens and all kinds of signs
I taught you melodies, poems, and rhymes
Oh, you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you
(You can run, but you can't escape)
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins
(You will open the yawning grave)
Oh, you fool, there are rules, I am coming for you
(You can run, but you can't escape)
Darkness brings evil things, oh, the reckoning begins
(You will open the yawning grave)

Leave me where the light pours down
Through the trees like rain
Let it wash over me like a flood
Let it ease my pain
Let it drown me
For a while I was held
By the myth of the lost highway
In the spell of the night
And the lights of the great white way
I ain't lonely
Are you?
Send me to the mountains
Let me go free forever (ever)
I'll be running through the forest
Dancing in the fields like this forever (ever)
(Long lost)
Leave me where the moonbeams
Carve through the leaves like blades
Lay me in the tall grown grass in a shallow grave
Let it have me
I've got a place in the world
And I found my way
Out in the night all alone
In the way out there
I ain't lonely
I'm long lost
Say goodbye (long lost)
Stay with my mind (long lost)
Send me to the mountains
Let me go free forever (ever)
I'll be running through the forest
Dancing in the fields like this forever (ever)
Send me to the mountains
Let me go free forever (ever)
I'll be running through the forest
Dancing in the fields like this forever (ever)
(Long lost)
(Long lost)
(Long lost)

I'm just a man, but I know that I'm damned
All the dead seem to know where I am
The tale that began on the night of my birth
Will be done in a turn of the earth
Lie where I land, let my bones turn to sand
I was born on the lake and I don't want to leave it
Every eye on the coast ever more
Will remember the sight of the ghost on the shore
Under the waves and the earth of an age
Lie a thousand old northerners' graves
Deep in the night when the moon's glowing bright
They come rising up into the night
Die if I must, let my bones turn to dust
I'm the lord of the lake and I don't want to leave it
All who sail off the coast ever more
Will remember the tale of the ghost on the shore
I'm going away for a long time
I'm going away for a long time
Lie where I land, let my bones turn to sand
I was born on the lake and I don't want to leave it
Every eye on the coast ever more
Will remember the sight of the ghost on the shore
Die if I must, let my bones turn to dust
I'm the lord of the lake and I don't want to leave it
All who sail off the coast ever more
Will remember the tale of the ghost on the shore
I'm going away for a long time

I've been through the desert and I've been 'cross the sea
I've been walking through the mountains
I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her, wanna give what I've got
She lit a fire and now, she's in my every thought
Where, could that girl have gone
Where, I've wandered far
Where, could that girl have gone
She left no trail, but I cannot fail, I will find her
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
Where, could that girl have gone
Where, I've wandered far
Where, could that girl have gone
She left no trace but I know her face, I will find her
When last I saw her, she was dancing all alone
Perhaps my chance was then, I'll never know
I'll search the world until there's no place left to go
And if she leaves it, I will follow, yeah, I will follow
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought
I've been through the desert and I've been 'cross the sea
I've been walking through the mountains
I've wandered through the trees for her
I have been trying to find her, want to give what I got
She lit a fire, and now she's in my every thought

I want to live in a land of lakes
Where the great waves break
And the night runs right into the day
I wanna be with ones I left
But I'm way out West
And the years keep on slipping away
Want to run on the sacred dunes
Through the ancient ruins
Where the fires of my ancestors burn
I remember the fateful day when I ran away
And you told me I couldn't return
You made me swear I'd never forget
I made a vow I'd see you again
I will be back one day
And I'll find you there by the great big lake
I been running a long, long time
Trying to flee that life
But I can't seem to leave it behind
Wanna visit the windswept shores of the time before
When the moon and the stars were aligned
I remember the bright spring day
When you sparked a flame
And a fire that continues to burn
I remember the day I left headin' way out West
When you told me to never return
You made me swear I'd never forget
I made a vow I'd see you again
I will be back one day
And I'll find you there by the great big lake
I will be back one day
And I'll find you there by the great big lake

I said we're all gonna die, but I'll never believe it
I love this world and I don't wanna leave it
They say that death is a deal that you cannot refuse
But I love you, girl, and I don't wanna lose you
Don't want a long ride
I don't wanna die at all
I want to be the man who lives forever
I ain't never gonna die and I want you to come
They say that life is a tale, it begins and it ends
And forever's a word that we can't understand
Well, I know that my life's better when we're together
So why can't our story just go on forever?
Don't want a long ride
I don't wanna die at all
I want to be the man who lives forever
I ain't never gonna die and I want you to come
They say life without end wouldn't have any meaning
The journey to death is the point of our being
Well, the point of my life is to be with you, baby
But there ain't enough time in the life that they gave me
I said we're all gonna die but I'll never believe it
I love this world and I don't wanna leave it
They say that death is a deal that you cannot refuse
But I love you, girl and I don't wanna lose you
I want to be the man who lives forever
I want to be the man who lives forever
I want to be the man who lives forever
I want to be the man who lives forever
And all those days and all those nights
And all those days and all those nights
And all those days and all those nights
(Forever together, forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights
(Forever together, forever alive)
And all those day and all those nights
(Forever together, forever alive)
And all those days and all those nights
(Forever together, forever alive)

You arise along with the sun
Where have you been, darlin'? What have you done?
You were out finding trouble again
There's a fire in your eyes and there's blood on your hands
Come inside and lie down to sleep
You ain't gonna run, and you know that you're beat
Rest awhile, they're coming for you
There's a price to be paid for the things that we do
Fall asleep and forget all your troubles
Dream of laughter and old friends and lovers
Dream of when you were innocent
Dream forever
Lord knows you've been 'round in your day
This kind of trouble, won't just go away
Darlin', now you're adrift in the deep
So just lay down your head, and I'll sing you to sleep
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

How long have I known you, brother?
Hundreds of lives, thousands of years
How many miles have we wandered
Under the sky, chasing our fear?
Some kind of trouble is coming
Don't know when, don't know what
I will stand by you, brother
'Til the daylight comes or I'm dead and gone
I've shared my life with you, brother
Since I recall, you've been my friend
You say we're not like the others
Still we must die, all things must end
I know we can't stop what's coming
But I will try, oh, how I'll try
Will you fight with me, brother?
One last time, one last fight
Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers 'til the end
Don't run away, our time will come but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you 'til the end
Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers 'til the end
Don't run away, our time will come but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you 'til the end
Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers 'til the end
Don't run away, our time will come but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you 'til the end
Don't turn away, don't tell me that we're not the same
We face the fire together, brothers 'til the end
Don't run away, our time will come but not today
I stand beside you, brother, with you 'til the end

You've been gone for a long long time
You've been in the wind, you've been on my mind
You are the purest soul I've ever known in my life
Take your time, let the rivers guide you in
You know where you can find me again
I'll be waiting here 'till the stars fall out of the sky
When you left I was far too young
To know you're worth more than the moon and the sun
You are still alive when I look to the sky in the night
I would wait for a thousand years
I would sit right here by the lake, my dear
You just let me know that you're coming home
And I'll wait for you
Years have gone but the pain is the same
I have passed my days by the sound of your name
Well they say that you're gone and I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby?
Death is a wall but it can't be the end
You are my protector and my best friend
Well they say that you're gone and that I should move on
I wonder: how do they know, baby?
How do they know? Well, they don't

I can't trust anyone or anything these days
If you are who you say you are, then show your face
Came out of the ocean like you came out of a dream
Your voice it sounds familiar, but you are not what you seem
All words of comfort can not take away my doubt
I've decided if it kills me, I'll find out what you're about
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers, you're the strangest that I've see
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
If you are who you say you are, then show me your face
Know enough to say you are not what you claim to be
I've kept close watch upon you and I don't like what I see
Can't escape the feeling that you'll get me in the night
I'll sleep with one eye open, and I'm not afraid to fight
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
But I know what you want and why
Of all the strangers, you're the strangest that I've see
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
Know what you want and why
Of all the strangers, you're the strangest that I've see
I'm not afraid to die
I can't trust anyone or anything these days
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
You are not the one you say you are
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your name
Now that I've seen your face, I'm haunted by the letters of your-

Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, few have seen it but everybody talks
Spirits follow me where I go
Oh, they sing all day and they haunt me in the night
Oh, they sing all day and they haunt me in the night
Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and what ain't living can never really die
You don't want me, baby, please don't lie
Oh, but if you're leaving, I gotta know why
I said, if you're leaving I gotta know why
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Yes, I know that love is like ghosts
Oh, and the moonlight, baby, shows you what's real
There ain't language for the things I feel
And if I can't have you, then no one ever will
Oh, If I can't have you, then no one ever will
I don't feel it 'til it hurts sometimes
Oh, go on, baby, hurt me tonight
I want ours to be an endless song
Baby, in my eyes, you can do no wrong
I don't feel it 'til it hurts sometimes
Oh, go on, baby, hurt me tonight
Haunted spirits that I know I saw
They see no ghosts in me at all
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night
Oh, I sing all day and I love you through the night

I had a vision tonight that the world was ending
Yeah, the sky was falling and the time was bending
I watched the heavens collide right before my eyes
What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day
I had a visitor come from the great beyond
Telling me our time in the world is done
And to watch for a sign in the midnight sky
What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day
What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day
We wait for the sunrise
We watch as the world dies
We howl in the moonlight
When the World Ender comes, baby, don't close your eyes
We wait for the sunrise
We wait for the sunrise
I had a vision tonight that the world is ending
Yeah, the sky was falling and time was bending
We spent our last night in the moonlight
Baby it's so bright, we'll be up all night
I got a hell of a view for the end of the world
I've got a bottle of booze and a beautiful girl
If I'm goin' to die, I'm gonna go in style
What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day
What if the world dies with the sunrise?
Baby it's all right, we'll be up all night
What if we're unmade when the stars fade?
Keep me going 'til the night turns into the day
Well, I'll be going 'til the night turns into the day
Yeah, I'll be going 'til the night turns into the day
Yeah, I'll be going 'til the night turns into the day
Yeah, keep me going 'til the night turns into the day

I get by, but I'm tired of myself
And I doubt that I ever will find someone else
Lonely days fall like drops in the lake of our love
I just want it to be like it was
And I want you to be as you were long ago
I go down to the edge of the lake
Where I wait through the night for the dawn light to break
Memories of yore crash like waves on the shore of my mind
And I pray that the stars will align
I just want us to be who we were long ago
I just want what was
How I yearn for the years we were young and in love
I get by, but it's hard to forget
In the smoke of denial and the fog of regret
Dismal and dark, some like clouds in the sky of my soul
And I hear thunder roll
I look up at the uncaring sky
With a prayer on my lips and a tear in my eye
Oh, how the heart burns like fire in the light of the moon
I just hope you'll be coming back soon
You're my long-lost love
Can we wind back the wheels to the way that it was?

Oh, where did the time go?
Oh, where did the time go?
It's been delightful
May you laugh and sing your life full
May you learn the reasons why
May you live until you die

All messed up with nowhere to go
I stare at myself in the mirror alone
It's hard to make friends when you're half in the grave
But I ain't dead yet, and I got something to say
You got holes in your clothes and booze on your breath
You look like hell, and you smell like death
There's a stranger in my eyes again
I swear to God I don't know him
You're tired of me, I'm tired of you
So turn around and leave it to myself
You got holes in your clothes and booze on your breath
You look like hell, and you smell like death
Been out way too long, headin' right for the edge
If she asks about me, tell her I'm not dead yet
You got holes in your clothes and booze on your breath
You look like hell, and you smell like death

I don't want to lose you
You know I don't, but I can't stay here
I just can't
If you've never heard a word of that tragic tale
When you hear these two sing together, you just feel something
Deep down inside you

I swore that I'd become a better man for you, and I tried
Tried to change my ways and walk the line you follow
I bore a flame that burned a thousand suns for you, but it died
Told you I could never love somebody else, but I lied
Ooh, I lied
Ooh, I lied
I told you I'd be coming back again for you, but I'm not
Going way out where the world will never find me
I made a claim that I would dance until we're bones with my bride
Told you I would never leave you all alone, but I lied
I read your letter in the morning by the lake, and I cried
They were tears of joy, my chains are finally broken
I made a vow to stand beside you 'til the day that I die
Told you I could never live without your love, but I lied
Ooh, I lied
Ooh, I lied
Ooh, I lied
Ooh, I lied
Ooh, I lied
Ooh, I lied

Lonely, all on my own just like I wanted to be
Lost out at sea
I might stay on my island for a couple of years
See how it feels
Floating, tired and lonesome
Like I promised to be
Lost out at sea
I might stay in my mind for a couple of years
Face all my fears

So much to say, but my words mean nothing
A life spent talking when my epitaph would do
Wasting my days with my mind on the future
And my past like a chain that won't ever let me go
Where would I go, and would a lone soul miss me?
If I leave in the night, I'll only be running
With the weight of the world at the tips of my fingers
A long-lost soul in the wilderness alone
All of the joy I've known
The ways I've grown
The loves I've shown my heart to
I'm gonna get it together, ooh
And live forever
And live forever
Day after day, oh, the world keeps turning
The stars in the sky above us keep burnin'
But it isn't for you, and it ain't for me neither
Try though I might, I was never a believer
Taking it slow, but it all goes quickly
The time that it takes is all I'll take with me
So, I'm saving it up just to go out and spend it
Gonna fly through my life 'til I crash into the ending
All of the joy I've known
The ways I've grown
The loves I've shown my heart to
I'm gonna get it together, ooh
And live forever
I'll make a deal with the devil, ooh
And live forever, and I don't think why
I don't know why
What does it mean if it all means nothing?
What does it mean if it all means nothing?
What does it mean if it all means nothing?
What does it mean if it all means nothing?
What does it mean if it all means nothing?
What does it mean if it all means nothing?
What does it mean if it all means nothing?
Thank you, thank you, thank you, folks
It's been delightful
So long, good luck, goodbye
Until next time, may you live until you die!

I won't be the one to say you'll never come back again
Though I don't think you will
I won't be the reason why you stay until you're dead
Although I hoped you would
I know what you've done, and I know who you've been dreaming of
I know where you go in the dead of night
You don't get to be the one who's young and wild and in love
You don't get to live your other life
I don't need to hear you say you'll never go wrong again
Because I know you will
I don't need the reasons why you've done the things you did
Because it's over with
I won't waste another day on you, I played the fool
I guess that's part of love
I won't shed another tear, I've nothing left to feel
And now I've said enough
You're living in your other life
I'll leave you in another life
I just came to say that I will never forget you, dear
How can I forgive your awful lies?
What I say today will be the very last words you hear
You don't get to live your other life

I still look at you with eyes that want you
When you move, you make my oceans move too
If I hear my name, I will run your way
Can we say that we love each other
Can we play like there ain't no other
If I hear my name, I will run your way
It's my desire that you feed
You know just what I need
You got power
Power
You got power over me
I give my all now, can't you see
Why wont you set me free?
You got power
Power
You got power over me
I was lost until I find me in you
I saw a side of me that I was scared to
But now I hear my name and I'm running your way
All I feel is I get closer to you
It's that desire to move like you do
So now I hear my name and I'm running your way hey
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
I am ready now (If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
(If you ready now)
It's my desire that you feed
You know just what I need
You got power (power)
Power (power)
You got power over me
I give my all know, can't you see
Why wont you set me free?
You got power (power)
Power (power)
You got power over me
You're the one that seduced me
Lured me in with your beauty
Now I know that you used me
(I'm ready now)
(I'm ready now)
All you did was confuse me
You're not longer what I need
Touch me slow, feel my heart bleed
(I'm ready now)
I'm ready now

Telling myself, "I won't go there"
Oh, but I know that I won't care
Tryna wash away all the blood I've spilled
This lust is a burden that we both share
Two sinners can't atone from a lone prayer
Souls tied, intertwined by our pride and guilt
(Ooh) there's darkness in the distance
From the way that I've been livin'
(Ooh) but I know I can't resist it
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Tellin' myself it's the last time
Can you spare any mercy that you might find
If I'm down on my knees again?
Deep down, way down, Lord, I try
Try to follow your light, but it's nighttime
Please don't leave me in the end
(Oh) there's darkness in the distance
I'm begging for forgiveness
(Ooh) but I know I might resist it, oh
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
You and I drink the poison from the same vine
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time
Hidin' all of our sins from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
From the daylight, runnin' from the daylight
Oh, I love it and I hate it at the same time

You make me not feel like a man
Keep throwin' stones for while you can
I know myself and who I am
There are stories in these callused hands
That not a soul will ever hear
I've only grown from the tears
I'm the dead man in this war
But, baby, I've been here before
There's beauty hidden in the gore
Yeah, I'm the dead man in this war, ooh-ooh
Do you remember September?
Do you remember September?
You threw me back into the fire
I screamed while your smile was gettin' wider, oh-oh
Demons and angels in my choir, mmm
Singin' about what I desire
And not a soul will ever hear, oh-oh, ooh
I've only grown from the tears, ooh-ooh
I'm the dead man in this war
But, baby, I've been here before
There's beauty hidden in the gore
Yeah, I'm the dead man in this war, ooh-ooh
Do you remember September?
Do you remember September?
Wait on, wait on
Give me back my old salvation
Wait on, wait on
Give me back my old salvation
Wait on, wait on
Give me back my old salvation
Wait on, wait on, yeah
I'm the dead man in this war (oh)
But, baby, I've been here before (I've been here before)
There's beauty hidden in the gore (yeah)
Yeah, I'm the dead man in this war, ooh-ooh
Yeah, oh
Yeah, oh
There's beauty hidden in the gore
I'm the dead man in this war

I fantasize to feel you like a bullet
And all your layers to the fullest
But the heavens won't condone it, mm
You deceivin', wayward woman
You're a false prophet at the pulpit
The condition of your soul is erodin'
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control
As your flatter talk shivers down my spine
I hear the Holy One exposin' all the lies
Lord, forgive me, I know my flesh needs to die
She has the lips red as cherry wine
A poisonous kiss, she's part of the swine
My salvation won't be sacrificed
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control
But I don't wanna stop, yeah, I just need to see
If your love's the truth or the spirit of deceit
No, I don't wanna talk, baby, give it all to me
There's honey drippin' from your teeth
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control, yeah, as you pull me close
Wrap me in your skin and bones, yeah, you're electrical
Oh, I'm gonna lose control
But I don't wanna stop, yeah, I just need to see
If your love's the truth or the spirit of deceit
No, I don't wanna talk, baby, give it all to me
There's honey drippin' from your teeth

I'd bleed for you
I'll bear the bruise
If I feel the way you do
Oh, I'd be someone new
Someone new
Save me from the sickness that I love
Take me to your sweet oblivion
I'm kneeling at your altar, I'm down here on my knees
Take me to your sweet oblivion
Gladly, I await the knife
It slipped between these ribs of mine
With you, there's no dying shame
Just a breathless whispered grace
Kings and choirs sing your name
Angels standing at your gates
If precious blood is what it takes
I'm praying, won't you
Save me from the sickness that I love
Take me to your sweet oblivion?
I'm kneeling at your altar, I'm down here on my knees
Take me to your sweet oblivion
Take me to your
Take me to your
Take me to your
Take me to your
Sweet oblivion

Sipping on the poison, I don't wanna see
Something in my heart that's killing on me
Stealing all that I got
Lord, I don't wanna stop
Feigning for the dark side, down on my knees
Praying to a God that I wanna believe
I look to Heaven a lot
But Hell is coming in hot
Shadows fall over me
Strike me blind
Still, I see
The Devil calls, he never sleeps
And he left his name and number
Said just tell me what you need
Ooh, I'm outnumbered, yeah
Ooh, I'm so close to going under
Sipping on the poison, I don't wanna see
Something in my heart that's killing on me
Stealing all that I got
Lord, I don't wanna stop
Feigning for the dark side, down on my knees
Praying to a God that I wanna believe
I look to Heaven a lot
But Hell is coming in hot
And I feel it coming, and I feel it coming
And I feel it coming, Hell is coming in hot
Livin' in the in between
Of pearly gates and city streets
They both reach for me
Ooh, I'm outnumbered, yeah
Ooh, I'm so close to going under
Sipping on the poison, I don't wanna see
Something in my heart that's killing on me
Stealing all that I got
Lord, I don't wanna stop
Feigning for the dark side, down on my knees
Praying to a God that I wanna believe
I look to Heaven a lot
But Hell is coming in hot
And I feel it coming, and I feel it coming
And I feel it coming, but hell is coming in hot
And I feel it coming, and I feel it coming
And I feel it coming, but hell is coming in hot
Sipping on the poison, I don't wanna see
Something in my heart that's killing on me
I look to Heaven a lot
But Hell is coming in hot

You're wearing my halo, Heaven's divide
You're fooling the angels with your sweet eyes
You're preaching a fable of the innocent one
From oath to betrayal, look what you've done
If the waves call my name
Then I won't go down alone
Way down we go, oh-ooh
Oh, darling, we're buried at sea
Our fate rests down in the mystery
Dry bones sinking in the dead, dead water
While the earth grows darker, my dear (oh)
Oh, darling, we're buried at sea
Our sins lay cold in the depths beneath
Hell don't need another lawless martyr
And the Lord don't barter, I fear (oh)
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I suffered in silence, you ate from the vine
Oh, I'll spill the truth and let the world decide
If the waves call my name
Then I won't go down alone
Way down we go, ooh
Oh, darling, we're buried at sea
Our fate rests down in the mystery
Dry bones sinking in the dead, dead water
While the earth grows darker, my dear (oh)
Oh, darling, we're buried at sea
Our sins lay cold in the depths beneath
Hell don't need another lawless martyr
And the Lord don't barter, I fear (oh)
It's too late for your atonement
You found the box, but lost the key (help)
Honey, don't be so naive
Oh, darling, we're buried at sea
Our fate rests down in the mystery
Dry bones sinking in the dead, dead water
While the earth grows darker, my dear (oh)
Oh, darling, we're buried at sea
Our sins lay cold in the depths beneath
Hell don't need another lawless martyr
And the Lord don't barter, I fear (oh, hey)
Ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh (whoa)
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh, ooh (whoa)

Oh, my love
Hear me now
You're in my blood
You put me into the ground
Moving on
Tears on fire
Burn me like the California sun
There's a gravity pulling at our hearts
There's a light that's cutting through the darkness
We're the rose that never fell apart
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
Oh, my love
Where're you now?
We've become
Ghosts that roam in this town
Let this rust
Let this live
Or should we run
From all of the sins we commit?
There's a gravity pulling at our hearts
There's a light that's cutting through the darkness
We're the rose that never fell apart
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
There's a gravity pulling at our hearts
There's a light that's cutting through the darkness
We're the rose that never fell apart
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
In another universe, oh-oh, ooh-oh
Baby, we could last a lifetime
There's a gravity pulling at our hearts
There's a light that's cutting through the darkness
We're the rose that never fell apart
Baby, we could last a lifetime

Hm, mm, follow me
Said a long black dress on Halloween
If this is all just make-believe
It might not be real, but it's real to me
Hm, mm, let her in
If you love her, son, it ain't no sin
Where she ends is where you begin
If you run, you'll run right back again, hm
Yeah!
You can hide, but you can't stay gone
She'll find you, won't take her long
And she'll come on back with every dawn
And drag your ass where you belong
And you'll wake up all alone
On an old beat-down dirt country road
And you'll crawl back through fire and snow
'Cause there ain't no other place to go, hm
I need you like God needs the Devil, honey
Someday soon, this dust's gonna settle
Come real quick and get inside my mind
'Cause when I'm all fucked up, I don't feel no pain
Won't you run to me, run through my veins?
Baby, won't you come and get me high?
Hm, mm, I'm in love
In a nightmare, please don't wake me up
Got a bad case of making bad luck
It's who I am, not who I was
But that's life, boy, what can you do?
I need someone and I need 'em soon
I called the doc and got new shoes
But all roads still lead back to you
I need you like God needs the Devil, honey
Someday soon, this dust's gonna settle
Come real quick and get inside my mind
'Cause when I'm all fucked up, I don't feel no pain
Won't you run to me, run through my veins?
Baby, won't you come and get me high?
I said, I need you like God needs the Devil, honey
Someday soon, the dust's gonna settle
Come real quick and get inside my mind
'Cause when I'm all fucked up, I don't feel no pain
Won't you run to me, run through my veins?
Run to me, run through my veins
Baby, won't you come and get me high?
Baby, won't you come and get me high?

A falling star fell from your heart and landed in my eyes
I screamed aloud as it tore through them
And now it's left me blind
The stars, the moon
They have all been blown out
You've left me in the dark
No dawn, no day
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
And in the dark
I can hear your heartbeat
I tried to find the sound
But then it stopped
And I was in the darkness
So darkness I became
The stars, the moon
They have all been blown out
You've left me in the dark
No dawn, no day
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
I took the stars from my eyes and then I made a map
And knew that somehow I could find my way back
Then I heard your heart beating, you were in the darkness too
So I stayed in the darkness with you
The stars, the moon
They have all been blown out
You've left me in the dark
No dawn, no day
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart
The stars, the moon
They have all been blown out
You've left me in the dark (you left me in the dark)
No dawn, no day
I'm always in this twilight
In the shadow of your heart

You are the hole in my head
You are the space in my bed
You are the silence in between
What I thought and what I said
You are the nighttime fear
You are the morning when it's clear
When it's over, you're the start
You're my head, you're my heart
No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light (no light)
Tell me what you want me to say
Through the crowds I was crying out, and
In your place there were a thousand other faces
I was disappearing in plain sight
Heaven help me, I need to make it right
You want a revelation, you wanna get it right
But it's a conversation I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation, some kind of resolution
You want a revelation
No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light, no light (no light)
Tell me what you want me to say
Would you leave me if I told you what I've done?
And would you leave me if I told you what I've become?
'Cause it's so easy to say it to a crowd
But it's so hard, my love
To say it to you out loud
No light, no light in your bright blue eyes
I never knew daylight could be so violent
A revelation in the light of day
You can't choose what stays and what fades away
And I'd do anything to make you stay
No light (No light), no light (No light)
Tell me what you want me to say
You want a revelation, you wanna get it right
But, it's a conversation, I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation, some kind of resolution
You want a revelation
You want a revelation, you wanna get it right
But, it's a conversation, I just can't have tonight
You want a revelation, some kind of resolution
Tell me what you want me to say

When we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours in our skin
We were light and paper's thin
And when we first came here
We were cold and we were clear
With no colours in our skin
Until we let the spectrum in
Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
And when we come for you
We'll be dressed up all in blue
With the ocean in our arms
Kiss your eyes and kiss your palms
And when it's time to pray
We'll be dressed up all in grey
With metal on our tongues
And silver in our lungs
Say my name
And every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
And when we come back we'll be dressed in black
And you'll scream my name aloud
And we won't eat and we won't sleep
We'll drag bodies from the ground
So say my name
And every colour illuminates
And we are shining
And we'll never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
As every colour illuminates
We are shining
And we will never be afraid again
Say my name
We are shining
Say my name
Say my name
And we will never be afraid again

Lookin' up from underneath
Fractured moonlight on the sea
Reflections still look the same to me
As before I went under
And it's peaceful in the deep
Cathedral where you cannot breathe
No need to pray, no need to speak
Now I am under all
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the seabed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me
Though the pressure's hard to take
It's the only way I can escape
It seems a heavy choice to make
But now I am under, oh
And it's breaking over me
A thousand miles down to the seabed
Found the place to rest my head
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
And the arms of the ocean are carrying me
And all this devotion was rushing out of me (rushing out of me)
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner like me
But the arms of the ocean delivered me
And it's over
And I'm going under
But I'm not giving up
I'm just giving in
Slipping underneath
So, so cold but so sweet
In the arms of the ocean, so sweet and so cold
And all this devotion I never knew at all
And the crashes are heaven for a sinner released
And the arms of the ocean delivered me
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go (delivered me)
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, bever let me go (delivered me)
Never let me go, never let me go
Never let me go, never let me go (delivered me)
Never let me go, never let me go
And it's over (never let me go, never let me go)
And I'm going under (never let me go, never let me go)
But I'm not giving up (never let me go, never let me go)
I'm just giving in (never let me go, never let me go)
Oh (never let me go, never let me go)
Slipping underneath (never let me go, never let me go)
Ooh (never let me go, never let me go)
So cold and so sweet (never let me go, never let me go)
